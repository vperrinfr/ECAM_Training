### Download neural network flow design

The sample MNIST flow provided with IBM Watson Studio's Neural Network designer has a low accuracy. 

You can download a flow design with much better accuracy from here: [CNN MNIST](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deep-learning-demo/model-and-webservice/master/CNN_MNIST.nnd) (e.g. right click then *Save Link As* ...)

### Download WebApp
