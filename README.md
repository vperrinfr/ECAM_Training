# Watson on Node-RED

This repository is a collection of examples on how to use the Watson nodes in [Node-RED](http://nodered.org/).

To use these nodes, you first have to set up your environment. The information on the [introduction to Node-RED](/introduction_to_node_red/README.md) page will get you started in a few minutes. It helps you with:

- setting up your environment
- build your first 'Hello World' flow
- additional information on the non-Watson Nodes you use in the labs

There are different types of labs in this repository:

- [Basic examples](/basic_examples/README.md) are simple, standalone examples of how to call the individual Watson Node-RED nodes.

- [Advanced labs](/advanced_examples/README.md) are where different Watson Node-RED nodes are combined to create more complex applications.

- [Watson Contribution Nodes](/watson_contribution_nodes/README.md) show how to add Watson Developer Cloud contribution nodes to Node-RED

- [Node-RED Starter Kits](/starter-kits/README.md) are pre-built applications from which to start your own prototypes

Feel free to use this content, please let us know what you think of it!

## Region
The examples have been tested against the US South region but have not been fully tested against any other region. Most labs will work in other regions but there are some Watson utilities that only work in the US South region.
