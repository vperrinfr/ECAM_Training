Advances in research are giving doctors and patients hope that repairing injured spinal cords is a reachable goal.
Advances in basic research are also being matched by progress in clinical research, especially in understanding the kinds of physical rehabilitation that work best to restore function.
Some of the more promising rehabilitation techniques are helping spinal cord injury patients become more mobile.
What is Osteogenesis imperfecta OI?
Osteogenesis imperfecta OI is a rare genetic disorder that, like juvenile osteoporosis, is characterized by bones that break easily, often from little or no apparent cause.
Is there any treatment for Shaken Baby Syndrome?
Emergency treatment for a baby who has been shaken usually includes life-sustaining measures such as respiratory support and surgery to stop internal bleeding and bleeding in the brain.
Doctors may use brain scans, such as MRI and CT, to make a more definite diagnosis.
What is the prognosis for Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome?
Most symptoms can be reversed if detected and treated promptly.
However, improvement in memory function is slow and, usually, incomplete.
Without treatment, these disorders can be disabling and life-threatening.
Who gets diverticular disease?
Many people get diverticular disease.
Starting at age 40, the chance of getting it increases about every 10 years.
About half of people between the ages of 60 and 80 have diverticular disease.
Almost everyone over 80 has it.
What is a stoma?
During ostomy surgery of the bowel, a surgeon creates a stoma by bringing the end of the intestine through an opening in the abdomen and attaching it to the skin to create an opening outside the body.
A stoma may be three-fourths of an inch to a little less than 2 inches wide.
The stoma is usually located in the lower part of the abdomen, just below the beltline.
However, sometimes the stoma is located in the upper abdomen.
The surgeon and a wound, ostomy, and continence WOC nurse or an enterostomal therapist will work together to select the best location for the stoma.
A removable external collection pouch, called an ostomy pouch or ostomy appliance, is attached to the stoma and worn outside the body to collect intestinal contents or stool.
Intestinal contents or stool passes through the stoma instead of passing through the anus.
The stoma has no muscle, so it cannot control the flow of stool, and the flow occurs whenever peristalsis occurs.
Ileostomy and colostomy are the two main types of ostomy surgery of the bowel during which a surgeon creates a stoma.
What is A chest x ray?
A chest x ray is a painless test that creates pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your heart and lungs.
What is Preventing osteoporosis?
Preventing osteoporosis is a lifelong endeavor.
What is Multiple sclerosis MS?
Multiple sclerosis MS is a neuroinflammatory disease that affects myelin , a substance that makes up the membrane called the myelin sheath that wraps around nerve fibers axons.
How do AVMs damage the brain and spinal cord?
Even in the absence of bleeding or significant oxygen depletion, large AVMs can damage the brain or spinal cord simply by their presence.
They can range in size from a fraction of an inch to more than 2.5 inches in diameter, depending on the number and size of the blood vessels making up the lesion.
The larger the lesion, the greater the amount of pressure it exerts on surrounding brain or spinal cord structures.
The largest lesions may compress several inches of the spinal cord or distort the shape of an entire hemisphere of the brain.
Such massive AVMs can constrict the flow of cerebrospinal fluid - a clear liquid that normally nourishes and protects the brain and spinal cord - by distorting or closing the passageways and open chambers ventricles inside the brain that allow this fluid to circulate freely.
As cerebrospinal fluid accumulates, hydrocephalus results.
This fluid buildup further increases the amount of pressure on fragile neurological structures, adding to the damage caused by the AVM itself.
How Is Fanconi Anemia Diagnosed?
People who have Fanconi anemia FA are born with the disorder.
They may or may not show signs or symptoms of it at birth.
For this reason, FA isn't always diagnosed when a person is born.
In fact, most people who have the disorder are diagnosed between the ages of 2 and 15 years.
Is there any treatment for Hydranencephaly?
There is no definitive treatment for hydranencephaly.
Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
Hydrocephalus may be treated with a shunt a surgically implanted tube that diverts fluid from one pathway to another.
If there were another anthrax attack today, do you think the response would be different? How?
Greater familiarity with clinical and epidemiologic features of the disease old dogma would be ignored.
Situational awareness, coordination among agencies, incident command, emergency operations, risk communication capacities much improved.
Management of complexity of social media environment and timely provision and administration of medical countermeasures would be challenging.
What research is being done for Cerebral Aneurysms?
The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS conducts research in its laboratories at the National Institutes of Health NIH and also supports additional research through grants to major medical institutions.
The NINDS supports a broad range of basic and clinical research on intracranial aneurysms and other vascular lesions of the nervous system.
The Familial Intracranial Aneurysm study seeks to identify possible genes that may increase the risk of development of aneurysms in blood vessels in the brain.
Other research projects include genome-wide studies to identify genes or DNA sequences that may indicate families harboring one type of aneurysm may be at increased risk of another type; studies of chromosomes to identify aneurysm-related genes; and additional research on microsurgical clipping and endovascular surgery to treat various types of ruptured and unruptured aneurysms.
Where Can People Find More Information About Heritable Disorders of Connective Tissue ?
People with heritable disorders of connective tissue can contact professional and support groups that can supply more detailed information than is found here.
Most of them also have Internet websites.
Some major groups are listed below.
What Is Excessive Blood Clotting?

Regardless of the cause, blood clots can limit or block blood flow.
This can damage the body's organs and may even cause death.
What research is being done for Hydrocephalus?
The NINDS conducts and supports a wide range of fundamental studies that explore the complex mechanisms of normal brain development.
Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to protect, treat, and ultimately cure disorders such as hydrocephalus.
How Does a TBI Affect Consciousness?
Advances in imaging and other technologies have led to devices that help differentiate among the variety of unconscious states.
For example, an imaging test that shows activity in the brainstem but little or no activity in the upper brain would lead a physician to a diagnosis of vegetative state and exclude diagnoses of brain death and locked-in syndrome.
On the other hand, an imaging test that shows activity in the upper brain with little activity in the brainstem would confirm a diagnosis of locked-in syndrome, while invalidating a diagnosis of brain death or vegetative state.
The use of CT and MRI is standard in TBI treatment, but other imaging and diagnostic techniques that may be used to confirm a particular diagnosis include cerebral angiography, electroencephalography EEG, transcranial Doppler ultrasound, and single photon emission computed tomography SPECT.
What is Lactose intolerance?
Lactose intolerance is a common condition that is more likely to occur in adulthood, with a higher incidence in older adults.
How can hepatitis A be prevented?
The hepatitis A vaccine offers immunity to adults and children older than age 1.

That's why it's a good idea to check your skin regularly for new growths like moles or lumps or changes in old growths.
Tell your doctor or nurse right away if you find a change.
Who Is at Risk for Heart Block?
The risk factors for congenital and acquired heart block are different.
What is Hairy cell leukemia?
Hairy cell leukemia is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow.
What Does Echocardiography Show?
The size of your heart.
An enlarged heart might be the result of high blood pressure, leaky heart valves, or heart failure.
Echo also can detect increased thickness of the ventricles the heart's lower chambers.
Increased thickness may be due to high blood pressure, heart valve disease, or congenital heart defects.
What research is being done for Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease?

The goals of this research are to increase scientific understanding of these disorders and to find ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure them.
What should you expect during Bronchoscopy?
Bronchoalveolar lavage BRON-ko-al-VE-o-lar la-VAHZH.
For this method, your doctor passes a small amount of saline solution salt water through the bronchoscope and into part of your lung.
He or she then suctions the salt water back out.
The fluid picks up cells and bacteria from the airway, which your doctor can study.
What is healthy weight loss?
It's natural for anyone trying to lose weight to want to lose it very quickly.
But evidence shows that people who lose weight gradually and steadily about 1 to 2 pounds per week are more successful at keeping weight off.
Healthy weight loss isn't just about a diet or program.
It's about an ongoing lifestyle that includes long-term changes in daily eating and exercise habits.
What can a person expect after a flexible sigmoidoscopy?
Some results from a flexible sigmoidoscopy are available immediately after the procedure, and the health care provider will share results with the person.
Biopsy results take a few days to come back.
What is CDC's position on mandating flu vaccination for health care workers?
CDC conducts science-based investigations, research, and public health surveillance both nationally and internationally.
CDC adopts recommendations that are made by the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices.
These recommendations may be considered by state and other Federal agencies when making or enforcing laws.
However, CDC does not issue any requirements or mandates for state agencies, health systems, or health care workers regarding infection control practices, including influenza vaccination.
There are no legally mandated vaccinations for adults, except for persons entering military service.
CDC does recommend certain immunizations for adults, depending on age, occupation, and other circumstances, but these immunizations are not required by law.
What is Pompe disease?
Pompe disease is a rare estimated at 1 in every 40,000 births, inherited and often fatal disorder that disables the heart and skeletal muscles.
What is the prognosis for Muscular Dystrophy?
The prognosis for people with MD varies according to the type and progression of the disorder.

Some children with MD die in infancy while others live into adulthood with only moderate disability.
What are the signs and symptoms of Wilson disease?
When people have signs and symptoms, they usually affect the liver, the central nervous system, or both.
The central nervous system includes the brain, the spinal cord, and nerves throughout the body.
Sometimes a person does not have symptoms and a health care provider discovers the disease during a routine physical exam or blood test, or during an illness.
Children can have Wilson disease for several years before any signs and symptoms occur.
People with Wilson disease may have.

Hydration is a big part.
Is there any treatment for Chorea?
There is no standard course of treatment for chorea.
Treatment depends on the type of chorea and the associated disease.
Treatment for Huntington's disease is supportive, while treatment for Syndenham's chorea usually involves antibiotic drugs to treat the infection, followed by drug therapy to prevent recurrence.
Adjusting medication dosages can treat drug-induced chorea.
Metabolic and endocrine-related choreas are treated according to the causes of symptoms.
How Is Kawasaki Disease Treated?
Medicines are the main treatment for Kawasaki disease.
Rarely, children whose coronary heart arteries are affected may need medical procedures or surgery.
How are the mucolipidoses inherited?
The mucolipidoses are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, that is, they occur only when a child inherits two copies of the defective gene, one from each parent.
When both parents carry a defective gene, each of their children faces a one in four chance of developing one of the MLs.
At the same time, each child also faces a one in two chance of inheriting only one copy of the defective gene.
People who have only one defective gene are known as carriers.
These individuals do not develop the disease but they can pass the defective gene on to their own children.
Because the defective genes involved in certain forms of ML are known, tests can identify people who are carriers in some instances.
What should you expect after Ostomy Surgery?
Once the person is home from the hospital, the first week or two are considered an extension of the hospital stay.
Most people will tire quite easily when they first come home.
Getting enough rest is important.
Gradually, stamina and strength will improve.
Most people can return to work about 6 to 8 weeks after surgery.
People may have certain GI issues - - such as gas, diarrhea, and constipation - - as the bowel heals, depending on the type of bowel diversion.
At What Age Does HD Appear?
Some individuals develop symptoms of HD when they are very young - before age 20.
The terms early-onset or juvenile HD are often used to describe HD that appears in a young person.
A common sign of HD in a younger individual is a rapid decline in school performance.
Symptoms can also include subtle changes in handwriting and slight problems with movement, such as slowness, rigidity, tremor, and rapid muscular twitching, called myoclonus.
Several of these symptoms are similar to those seen in Parkinson's disease, and they differ from the chorea seen in individuals who develop the disease as adults.
These young individuals are said to have akinetic-rigid HD or the Westphal variant of HD.
People with juvenile HD may also have seizures and mental disabilities.
The earlier the onset, the faster the disease seems to progress.
The disease progresses most rapidly in individuals with juvenile or early-onset HD, and death often follows within 10 years.
Who Should Not be Vaccinated?
Who should not be vaccinated with Anthrax vaccine?
Making plans to travel internationally?

What is Mohs micrographic surgery?
Mohs micrographic surgery is a form of tumor excision that involves progressive radial sectioning and real-time examination of the resection margins until adequate uninvolved margins have been achieved, avoiding wider margins than needed.
How is BMI used?
BMI is used as a screening tool to identify possible weight problems for adults.
However, BMI is not a diagnostic tool.
For example, a person may have a high BMI.
However, to determine if excess weight is a health risk, a healthcare provider would need to perform further assessments.
These assessments might include skinfold thickness measurements, evaluations of diet, physical activity, family history, and other appropriate health screenings.
Is there any treatment for Chiari Malformation?
Medications may ease certain symptoms, such as pain.
Surgery is the only treatment available to correct functional disturbances or halt the progression of damage to the central nervous system.
More than one surgery may be needed to treat the condition.
Some CMs have no noticeable symptoms and do not interfere with the person's activities of daily living.
Why is it called Asperger syndrome?
Asperger's observations, published in German, were not widely known until 1981, when an English doctor named Lorna Wing published a series of case studies of children showing similar symptoms, which she called 'Asperger's' syndrome.
Wing's writings were widely published and popularized.
AS became a distinct disease and diagnosis in 1992, when it was included in the tenth published edition of the World Health Organization's diagnostic manual, International Classification of Diseases ICD-10, and in 1994 it was added to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM-IV, the American Psychiatric Association's diagnostic reference book.
However, scientific studies have not been able to definitively differentiate Asperger syndrome from highly functioning autism.
Because autism is defined by a common set of behaviors, changes that were announced in DSM-V which took effect in mid-2013 represent the various forms under a single diagnostic category, ASD.
How Does Vitamin A Affect My Bones?
Vitamin A is a family of fat-soluble compounds that play an important role in vision, bone growth, reproduction, cell division, and cell differentiation.
Vitamin A is important for healthy bones.
However, too much vitamin A has been linked to bone loss and an increase in the risk of hip fracture.
Scientists believe that excessive amounts of vitamin A trigger an increase in osteoclasts, the cells that break down bone.
They also believe that too much vitamin A may interfere with vitamin D, which plays an important role in preserving bone.
What is Paresthesia?
Chronic paresthesia is often a symptom of an underlying neurological disease or traumatic nerve damage.
Paresthesia can be caused by disorders affecting the central nervous system, such as stroke and transient ischemic attacks mini-strokes, multiple sclerosis, transverse myelitis, and encephalitis.
A tumor or vascular lesion pressed up against the brain or spinal cord can also cause paresthesia.
Nerve entrapment syndromes, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, can damage peripheral nerves and cause paresthesia accompanied by pain.
Diagnostic evaluation is based on determining the underlying condition causing the paresthetic sensations.
An individual's medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests are essential for the diagnosis.
Physicians may order additional tests depending on the suspected cause of the paresthesia.
How Is Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosed?
Doctors who treat patients in the emergency room often are the ones to diagnose PE with the help of a radiologist.
A radiologist is a doctor who deals with x rays and other similar tests.

Injection drug users have the highest risk.
Others at risk include.
Can Chagas disease be spread through blood transfusions?
Yes.
The disease can be spread by receiving blood that came from a person with Chagas disease.
How does the spinal cord work?
The spinal cord, like the brain, is enclosed in three membrane layers called meninges: the dura mater the tougher, most protective, outermost layer; the arachnoid middle layer; and the pia mater innermost and very delicate.
The soft, gel-like spinal cord is protected by 33 rings of bone called vertebrae, which form the spinal column.
Each vertebra has a circular hole, so when the rung-like bones are stacked one on top of the other there is a long hollow channel, with the spinal cord inside that channel.
The vertebrae are named and numbered from top to bottom according to their location along the backbone: seven cervical vertebrae C1-C7 are in the neck; twelve thoracic vertebrae T1-T12 attach to the ribs; five lumbar vertebrae L1-L5 are in the lower back; and, below them, five sacral vertebrae S1-S5 that connect to the pelvis.
The adult spinal cord is shorter than the spinal column and generally ends at the L1-L2 vertebral body level.
A thick set of nerves from the lumbar and sacral cord form the 'cauda equina' in the spinal canal below the cord.

Your body is working at a moderate level when you can talk but not sing.
Your body is working at a vigorous level when you can't say more than a few words without pausing for a breath.
What is the burden of Alzheimer's disease in the United States?
Death rates for Alzheimer's disease are increasing, unlike heart disease and cancer death rates that are on the decline.5 Dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, has been shown to be underreported in death certificates and therefore the proportion of older people who die from Alzheimer's may be considerably higher.
Is there any treatment for Gaucher Disease?
Enzyme replacement therapy is available for most people with types 1 and 3 Gaucher disease.
Given intravenously every two weeks, this therapy decreases liver and spleen size, reduces skeletal anomalies, and reverses other symptoms of the disorder, including abnormal blood counts.
The U.S.
Food and Drug Administration has approved taliglucerase alfa for long-term enzyme replacement in people with type 1 Gaucher disease.
Bone marrow transplantation a procedure to replace damaged or destroyed blood-forming cells can reverse the non-neurological effects of type 1 Gaucher disease, but the procedure carries a high risk and is rarely performed.
Surgery to remove the spleen may be required on rare occasions, and blood transfusions may benefit some anemic patients.
Other patients may require joint replacement surgery to improve mobility and quality of life.
There is no effective treatment for severe brain damage that may occur in persons with types 2 and 3 Gaucher disease.
What is Hematocrit?
Hematocrit is a measure of how much space red blood cells take up in your blood.

Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure disorders, such as prosopagnosia.
What is Orthostatic Hypotension?
Orthostatic hypotension is a sudden fall in blood pressure that occurs when a person assumes a standing position.
It is due to a lesion of the baroreflex loop, which senses a change in blood pressure and adjusts heart rate and activates sympathetic nerve system fibers to cause the blood vessels to narrow and correct blood pressure.
It may also be caused by hypovolemia a decreased amount of blood in the body, resulting from the excessive use of diuretics, vasodilators, or other types of drugs, dehydration, or prolonged bed rest.
The disorder may be associated with Addison's disease, diabetes, and certain neurological disorders including Multiple System Atrophy with Orthostatic Hypotension formerly known as Shy-Drager syndrome, autonomic system neuropathies, and other dysautonomias.
Symptoms, which generally occur after sudden standing, include dizziness, lightheadedness, blurred vision, and syncope temporary loss of consciousness.

If the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing to the brain and other vital organs.
SCA usually causes death if it's not treated within minutes.
What is the prognosis for Dyslexia?
For those with dyslexia, the prognosis is mixed.
The disability affects such a wide range of people and produces such different symptoms and varying degrees of severity that predictions are hard to make.
The prognosis is generally good, however, for individuals whose dyslexia is identified early, who have supportive family and friends and a strong self-image, and who are involved in a proper remediation program.
What is Paget's disease?
Paget's disease is a chronic disorder that can result in enlarged and misshapen bones.
What is the Prognosis?
The prognosis for individuals with Bell's palsy is generally very good.
The extent of nerve damage determines the extent of recovery.
Improvement is gradual and recovery times vary.
With or without treatment, most individuals begin to get better within 2 weeks after the initial onset of symptoms and most recover completely, returning to normal function within 3 to 6 months.
For some, however, the symptoms may last longer.
In a few cases, the symptoms may never completely disappear.
In rare cases, the disorder may recur, either on the same or the opposite side of the face.

What is Folic acid folate?
Folic acid folate is a form of vitamin B that's found in foods.
Can antacids or milk help a peptic ulcer heal?
People used to believe drinking milk helped peptic ulcers heal.
But doctors know now that while milk may make an ulcer feel better briefly, it also increases stomach acid, which makes ulcers worse.
Patients should talk with their doctor about drinking milk while an ulcer is healing.
2.
What Goes Wrong In Parkinson's Disease?
PD is a devastating and complex disease that interferes with movement more and more as time goes on.
It also produces a wide range of other problems for patients.
Symptoms of the disease vary somewhat, but they may include problems with swallowing and chewing, speech impairments, urinary problems or constipation, excessive sweating and other skin problems, depression and other emotional changes, and difficulties with sleep.
No one can predict which of these symptoms will affect a particular patient, and the intensity of the symptoms varies from person to person.
None of these secondary symptoms is fatal, although swallowing problems can cause choking.
Is there any treatment for Hemicrania Continua?
Indomethacin provides rapid relief from symptoms.
Patients must take between 25 and 300 milligrams of indomethacin daily and indefinitely to decrease symptoms.
Some individuals may need to take acid-suppression medicine due to a gastrointestinal side effect.
For those who cannot tolerate the side effects, another NSAID, celecoxib, has been shown to have less complications and can be prescribed.
Amitriptyline and other tricyclic antidepressants are also effective in some individuals with hemicrania continua as a preventative treatment.
What research is being done for Inclusion Body Myositis?

As cardiomyopathy worsens, the heart becomes weaker.
It's less able to pump blood through the body and maintain a normal electrical rhythm.
This can lead to heart failure or irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias ah-RITH-me-ahs.
In turn, heart failure can cause fluid to build up in the lungs, ankles, feet, legs, or abdomen.

Read more about getting your child's shots on schedule.
What Is Paget's Disease?
Paget's disease is a chronic disorder that can result in enlarged and misshapen bones.
The excessive breakdown and formation of bone tissue causes affected bone to weaken, resulting in pain, misshapen bones, fractures, and other bone and joint problems, including osteoarthritis.
Paget's disease typically is localized, affecting just one or a few bones, as opposed to osteoporosis, for example, which affects all the bones in the body.
Scientists do not know for sure what causes Paget's disease.

Bilirubin is the pigment that gives bile its reddish-yellow color.
How do public health authorities investigate cases of GBS?
In addition to the normal vaccine safety monitoring systems, CDC has proactively put additional monitoring systems in place to ensure safety after licensing.
Some of these systems include: actively observing persons in defined geographic areas, collaborating with professional organizations for reports of any adverse events after vaccination, and conducting thorough investigations when severe adverse events occur to determine whether they may have been associated with the vaccine.
Through these numerous approaches, we are able to detect any possible risk of GBS that might be associated with the 2012-2013 flu vaccines as early as possible and take appropriate action.
What is the prognosis for Striatonigral Degeneration?
Striatonigral degeneration progresses slowly.
Some patients have normal life expectancy.
What causes constipation in children?
Constipation is caused by stool spending too much time in the colon.
The colon absorbs too much water from the stool, making it hard and dry.
Hard, dry stool is more difficult for the muscles of the rectum to push out of the body.

What is Getting tested?
Getting tested is the only way to know for sure if you have an STD.
How does stress affect IBS?
Stress can stimulate colon spasms in people with IBS.
The colon has many nerves that connect it to the brain.
These nerves control the normal contractions of the colon and cause abdominal discomfort at stressful times.
In people with IBS, the colon can be overly responsive to even slight conflict or stress.
Stress makes the mind more aware of the sensations that arise in the colon.
IBS symptoms can also increase a person's stress level.
Some options for managing stress include.
What research is being done for Stiff-Person Syndrome?
The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS conducts research related to SPS in its laboratories at the National Institutes of Health NIH, and also supports additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country.

What should people to do if they determine they haveStachybotrys chartarumStachybotrys atra in their buildings or homes?
Mold growing in homes and buildings, whether it is Stachybotrys chartarum Stachybotrys atra or other molds, indicates that there is a problem with water or moisture.
This is the first problem that needs to be addressed.
Mold growth can be removed from hard surfaces with commercial products, soap and water, or a bleach solution of no more than 1 cup of bleach in 1 gallon of water.
Mold in or under carpets typically requires that the carpets be removed.
Once mold starts to grow in insulation or wallboard, the only way to deal with the problem is by removal and replacement.
We do not believe that one needs to take any different precautions with Stachybotrys chartarum Stachybotrys atra, than with other molds.
In areas where flooding has occurred, prompt drying out of materials and cleaning of walls and other flood-damaged items with commercial products, soap and water, or a bleach solution of no more than 1 cup of bleach in 1 gallon of water is necessary to prevent mold growth.
Never mix bleach with ammonia or other household cleaners.
If a home has been flooded, it also may be contaminated with sewage.
See: After a Hurricane or Flood: Cleanup of Flood Water Moldy items should be removed from living areas.

In the United States, the biggest risk of human illnesses from animals, especially to young children, is getting infected with germs like Salmonella, E.
coli O157:H7 and others that cause vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramping.
Animals can also carry germs that cause other kinds of diseases, such as rabies.
Animals may have germs on their bodies and in their droppings, even when they appear clean and healthy.
The germs can also get on cages, bedding, and wherever animals roam or walk around, and can contaminate these areas.
Who Is at Risk for Rh Incompatibility?
CVS also may be done during pregnancy.
For this test, your doctor threads a thin tube through the vagina and cervix to the placenta.
He or she removes a tissue sample from the placenta using gentle suction.
The tissue sample is tested for various reasons.
Does the IRAT have any limitations?
Yes.
The IRAT cannot predict the next pandemic.
Furthermore, the IRAT is not intended to eliminate the need for subject matter expertise.
In fact, subject matter experts are needed to carefully analyze the 10 criteria used by the IRAT to make determinations of pandemic risk and to rank the importance of the criteria according to the specific risk question or situation.
Lastly, the IRAT is not intended to make exact risk estimates.
For example, many risk assessments generate a quantitative measure that describes the likelihood of exposure or disease risk.
The IRAT focuses on the perceived pandemic potential of novel influenza viruses as estimated by subject matter experts using the IRAT evaluation criteria and available data.
What is Multiple system atrophy MSA?
Multiple system atrophy MSA is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a combination of symptoms that affect both the autonomic nervous system and movement.

Fatty materials can accumulate in the spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow, and brain.
Symptoms may include skeletal disorders, enlarged spleen and liver, liver malfunction, anemia, and yellow spots in the eyes.
There are three clinical subtypes of Gaucher disease.
The first category, called type 1 or nonneuropathic, is the most common.
Symptoms may begin early in life or in adulthood.
People in this group usually bruise easily due to low blood platelets and experience fatigue due to anemia They also have an enlarged liver and spleen, skeletal disorders, and, in some instances, lung and kidney impairment.
There are no signs of brain involvement.
Symptoms can appear at any age.
Many individuals may have a mild form of the disorder and not show any symptoms.
In type 2 Gaucher disease acute infantile neuropathic Gaucher disease, liver and spleen enlargement are apparent by 3 months of age.
Individuals usually die before 2 years of age.
In the third category, called type 3 or chronic neuropathic Gaucher disease, liver and spleen enlargement is variable, and signs of brain involvement such as seizures gradually become apparent.
Major symptoms also include skeletal irregularities, eye movement disorders, seizures, respiratory problems and blood disorders.

Your doctor will diagnose anemia based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and results from tests and procedures.
What is indigestion?
Indigestion, also known as dyspepsia, is a term used to describe one or more symptoms including a feeling of fullness during a meal, uncomfortable fullness after a meal, and burning or pain in the upper abdomen.
What are Mucopolysaccharidoses?
The mucopolysaccharidoses are a group of inherited metabolic diseases in which a defective or missing enzyme causes large amounts of complex sugar molecules to accumulate in harmful amounts in the body's cells and tissues.
This accumulation causes permanent, progressive cellular damage that affects appearance, physical abilities, organ and system functioning, and, in most cases, mental development.
Depending on the type of mucopolysaccharidosis, affected individuals may have normal intellect or may be profoundly retarded, may experience developmental delay, or have severe behavioral problems.
Physical symptoms generally include coarse or rough facial features, thick lips, an enlarged mouth and tongue, short stature with a disproportionately short trunk dwarfism, abnormal bone size or shape and other skeletal irregularities, thickened skin, enlarged organs such as the liver or spleen, hernias, and excessive body hair growth.

It also can prevent you from sleeping well and interfere with work and socializing.
A chronic cough also can cause headaches, chest pain, loss of bladder control, sweating, and, rarely, fractured ribs.
A Pain Primer: What Do We Know About Pain?
The idea of using receptors as gateways for pain drugs is a novel idea, supported by experiments involving substance P.
Investigators have been able to isolate a tiny population of neurons, located in the spinal cord, that together form a major portion of the pathway responsible for carrying persistent pain signals to the brain.
When animals were given injections of a lethal cocktail containing substance P linked to the chemical saporin, this group of cells, whose sole function is to communicate pain, were killed.
Receptors for substance P served as a portal or point of entry for the compound.
Within days of the injections, the targeted neurons, located in the outer layer of the spinal cord along its entire length, absorbed the compound and were neutralized.
The animals' behavior was completely normal; they no longer exhibited signs of pain following injury or had an exaggerated pain response.
Importantly, the animals still responded to acute, that is, normal, pain.
This is a critical finding as it is important to retain the body's ability to detect potentially injurious stimuli.
The protective, early warning signal that pain provides is essential for normal functioning.
If this work can be translated clinically, humans might be able to benefit from similar compounds introduced, for example, through lumbar spinal puncture.
Where do donated livers come from?
Most donated livers come from deceased donors - donors who have recently died.
Adults usually receive the entire liver from a deceased donor, although a segment of the liver can be transplanted when the donor liver is too large.
Because few donor livers come from children, pediatric recipients more often receive a portion of a liver from an adult donor.
Occasionally, an adult liver is split into two portions and given to two different recipients.
For example, the smaller left lobe may be given to a child and the larger right lobe given to an adult.
What Are the Parts of the Knee?
Like any joint, the knee is composed of bones and cartilage, ligaments, tendons, and muscles.

Colonoscopy.
Colonoscopy is the most commonly used test to specifically diagnose Crohn's disease.
This test is used to look inside your rectum, entire colon, and ileum.
The health care provider will give you written bowel prep instructions to follow at home before the test.
You may need to follow a clear liquid diet for 1 to 3 days before the test.
You will need to take laxatives and enemas the evening before the test, and you will likely have one or more enemas about 2 hours before the test.
A laxative is medicine that loosens stool and increases bowel movements.
An enema involves flushing water, laxative, or sometimes a mild soap solution into the anus using a special squirt bottle.
What is the prognosis for Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy?

What is An ischemic stroke?
An ischemic stroke is a cerebral infarction or brain attack.
WHAT IS PARKINSON'S DISEASE?
Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that results from degeneration of neurons in a region of the brain that controls movement.
This degeneration creates a shortage of the brain signaling chemical neurotransmitter known as dopamine, causing the movement impairments that characterize the disease.
Parkinson's disease was first formally described in An Essay on the Shaking Palsy, published in 1817 by a London physician named James Parkinson, but it has probably existed for many thousands of years.
Its symptoms and potential therapies were mentioned in the Ayurveda, the system of medicine practiced in India as early as 5000 BC, and in the first Chinese medical text, Nei Jing, which appeared 2500 years ago.
What are the evaluation criteria used by the IRAT?
The 'Attributes of the Population' category contains three of the 10 evaluation criteria, including: Existing population immunity refers to whether the human population has any existing immune protection against the novel influenza virus being evaluated.
Susceptibility to infection and severity of illness associated with specific influenza viruses may depend on age, geographic area, or genetic factors.
What is the prognosis for Neuronal Migration Disorders?

What is Paroxysmal hemicrania?
Paroxysmal hemicrania is a rare form of headache that usually begins in adulthood.
What research is being done for Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease?
The leading scientific theory at this time maintains that CJD is caused by a type of protein called a prion.
The harmless and the infectious forms of the prion protein are nearly identical, but the infectious form takes a different folded shape than the normal protein.
Researchers are examining whether the transmissible agent is, in fact, a prion and trying to discover factors that influence prion infectivity and how the disorder damages the brain.
Using rodent models of the disease and brain tissue from autopsies, they are also trying to identify factors that influence the susceptibility to the disease and that govern when in life the disease appears.
Is there any treatment for Brain and Spinal Tumors?
The three most commonly used treatments are surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.
Doctors also may prescribe steroids to reduce the swelling inside the CNS.
Is there any treatment for Syncope?
The immediate treatment for an individual who has fainted involves checking first to see if their airway is open and they are breathing.
The person should remain lying down for at least 10-15 minutes, preferably in a cool and quiet space.
If this isn't possible, have the individual sit forward and lower their head below their shoulders and between their knees.
Ice or cold water in a cup is refreshing.
For individuals who have problems with chronic fainting spells, therapy should focus on recognizing the triggers and learning techniques to keep from fainting.
At the appearance of warning signs such as lightheadedness, nausea, or cold and clammy skin, counter-pressure maneuvers that involve gripping fingers into a fist, tensing the arms, and crossing the legs or squeezing the thighs together can be used to ward off a fainting spell.
If fainting spells occur often without a triggering event, syncope may be a sign of an underlying heart disease.
How are babies screened?
Pulse oximetry is a simple bedside test to determine the amount of oxygen in a baby's blood and the baby's pulse rate.
Low levels of oxygen in the blood can be a sign of a CCHD.
The test is done using a machine called a pulse oximeter, with sensors placed on the baby's skin.
The test is painless and takes only a few minutes.
Pulse oximetry screening does not replace a complete history and physical examination, which sometimes can detect a CCHD before oxygen levels in the blood become low.
Pulse oximetry screening, therefore, should be used along with the physical examination.
How Much Vitamin A Do I Need?
The body can convert beta-carotene into vitamin A to help meet these requirements.
Although there is no RDA for beta-carotene, the National Institutes of Health NIH Office of Dietary Supplements recommends eating five or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day, including dark green and leafy vegetables and deep yellow or orange fruits to get appropriate amounts of beta-carotene.

To lessen the risk of being bitten by an infected mosquito or other insect, people should limit outdoor activities at night, wear long-sleeved clothing when outdoors, use insect repellents that are most effective for that particular region of the country, and rid lawn and outdoor areas of free-standing pools of water, in which mosquitoes breed.
Do not over-apply repellants, particularly on young children and especially infants, as chemicals such as DEET may be absorbed through the skin.
What should you expect after a Lung Ventilation/Perfusion Scan?
You may have a bruise on your arm where the radioisotopes were injected.
You'll need to drink plenty of fluids to flush the radioisotopes out of your body.
Your doctor can advise you about how much fluid to drink.
What is Fibromuscular Dysplasia?
Fibromuscular dysplasia FMD is the abnormal development or growth of cells in the walls of arteries that can cause the vessels to narrow or bulge.
The carotid arteries, which pass through the neck and supply blood to the brain, are commonly affected.
Arteries within the brain and kidneys can also be affected.
A characteristic 'string of beads' pattern caused by the alternating narrowing and enlarging of the artery can block or reduce blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke or mini-stroke.
Some patients experience no symptoms of the disease while others may have high blood pressure, dizziness or vertigo, chronic headache, intracranial aneurysm, ringing in the ears, weakness or numbness in the face, neck pain, or changes in vision.
FMD is most often seen in persons age 25 to 50 years and affects women more often than men.
More than one family member may be affected by the disease.
The cause of FMD is unknown.
An angiogram can detect the degree of narrowing or obstruction of the artery and identify changes such as a tear dissection or weak area aneurysm in the vessel wall.
FMD can also be diagnosed using computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or ultrasound.
How do medical procedures put people at risk for infections?
Germs can spread from one patient to another or from doctors to patients.
You are at greater risk from germs that can cause infections if you have:
What is Osteoporosis?
Osteoporosis is a condition in which the bones become less dense and more likely to fracture.
How common is it for humans to be infected with influenza viruses that normally spread in swine?
In the past, CDC received reports of approximately one human infected with influenza viruses that normally spread in swine every one to two years, but more recently, these cases have been detected more frequently.
See Case Count: Detected U.S.
Human Infections with Variant Influenza Viruses by State since December 2005.
The increased detection and reporting of these cases could be occurring for a number of reasons, including one or more of the following factors: First, pandemic preparedness efforts have improved state level surveillance and laboratory capacity to detect novel viruses in the United States.
Second, in 2007, novel influenza virus infections were made domestically and internationally reportable.
And three, it's also possible that there is a true increase in the number of these cases, possibly occurring from exposure to infected swine or through subsequent, limited human-to-human transmission.
What is the prostate?
The male prostate is a small sex gland that makes fluid to carry sperm.
It's located below the bladder and in front of the rectum.
What is Ultrasound?
Ultrasound is a noninvasive therapy used to warm the body's internal tissues, which causes muscles to relax.
How does swine flu spread among pigs?
Swine flu viruses are thought to be spread among pigs mostly through close contact and possibly from contaminated objects moving between infected and uninfected pigs.
Infected swine herds, including those vaccinated against swine flu, may have sporadic disease, or may show only mild or no symptoms of infection.
What is the main lesson learned from this study?
Seasonal influenza is associated with large numbers of hospitalizations.
The results of this study demonstrate the substantial health impact of seasonal influenza and underscore the need to ensure vaccination of people at increased risk of serious influenza complications, especially people 65 years and older.
What is Your healthcare provider?
Your healthcare provider is the best source of information on the benefits and risks of vaccines.
How is the test done?
A doctor or nurse can test your urine for gonorrhea.
Sometimes a sample is taken from the vagina or penis to test.
The test is easy and painless.
What research is being done for Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder?
Several components of the NIH support research on developmental disorders such as ADHD.
Research programs of the NINDS, the National Institute of Mental Health NIMH, and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development NICHD seek to address unanswered questions about the causes of ADHD, as well as to improve diagnosis and treatment.
What are Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies?
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease CJD is the most well-known of the human TSEs.
It is a rare type of dementia that affects about one in every one million people each year.
Other human TSEs include kuru, fatal familial insomnia FFI, and Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease GSS.
Kuru was identified in people of an isolated tribe in Papua New Guinea and has now almost disappeared.
FFI and GSS are extremely rare hereditary diseases, found in just a few families around the world.
A new type of CJD, called variant CJD vCJD, was first described in 1996 and has been found in Great Britain and several other European countries.
The initial symptoms of vCJD are different from those of classic CJD and the disorder typically occurs in younger patients.
Research suggests that vCJD may have resulted from human consumption of beef from cattle with a TSE disease called bovine spongiform encephalopathy BSE, also known as mad cow disease.
Other TSEs found in animals include scrapie, which affects sheep and goats; chronic wasting disease, which affects elk and deer; and transmissible mink encephalopathy.
In a few rare cases, TSEs have occurred in other mammals such as zoo animals.
These cases are probably caused by contaminated feed.
CJD and other TSEs also can be transmitted experimentally to mice and other animals in the laboratory.
What is A chest x ray?
A chest x ray is a painless test that creates pictures of the structures in the chest, such as the heart and lungs.
What Research Is Taking Place?
Many researchers are studying CJD.
They are examining whether the transmissible agent is, in fact, a prion or a product of the infection, and are trying to discover factors that influence prion infectivity and how the disorder damages the brain.
Using rodent models of the disease and brain tissue from autopsies, they are also trying to identify factors that influence susceptibility to the disease and that govern when in life the disease appears.
They hope to use this knowledge to develop improved tests for CJD and to learn what changes ultimately kill the neurons so that effective treatments can be developed.
What are the different forms of syringomyelia?
Generally, there are two forms of syringomyelia.
In most cases, the disorder is related to an abnormality of the brain called a Chiari I malformation, named after one of the physicians who first characterized it.
This anatomic abnormality causes the lower part of the cerebellum to protrude from its normal location in the back of the head into the cervical or neck portion of the spinal canal.
A syrinx may then develop in the cervical region of the spinal cord.
Because of the relationship that was once thought to exist between the brain and spinal cord in this type of syringomyelia, physicians sometimes refer to it as communicating syringomyelia.
Symptoms usually begin between the ages of 25 and 40 and may worsen with straining or any activity that causes CSF pressure to fluctuate suddenly.
Some individuals, however, may have long periods of functional stability.
Some people with this form of the disorder also have hydrocephalus, in which CSF accumulates in the brain, or a condition called arachnoiditis, in which a covering of the spinal cord - the arachnoid membrane - is inflamed.
Is there any treatment for Inflammatory Myopathies?
The chronic inflammatory myopathies can't be cured in most adults but many of the symptoms can be treated.
Options include medication, physical therapy, exercise, heat therapy including microwave and ultrasound, orthotics and assistive devices, and rest.
Polymyositis and dermatomyositis are first treated with high doses of prednisone or another corticosteroid drug.
This is most often given as an oral medication but can be delivered intravenously.
Immunosuppressant drugs, such as azathioprine and methotrexate, may reduce inflammation in people who do not respond well to prednisone.
IBM has no standard course of treatment.
The disease is generally unresponsive to corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs.
What should you expect before a Coronary Calcium Scan?
You don't need to take any special steps before having a coronary calcium scan.
However, your doctor may ask you to avoid caffeine and smoking for 4 hours before the test.
How is IBS diagnosed?
Flexible sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy are similar, although colonoscopy is used to view the rectum and entire colon, while flexible sigmoidoscopy is used to view just the rectum and lower colon.
These tests are performed at a hospital or an outpatient center by a gastroenterologist - a doctor who specializes in digestive diseases.
Before either test, a health care provider will give written bowel prep instructions to follow at home.
The person may be asked to follow a clear liquid diet for 1 to 3 days before either test.
The night before either test, the person may need to take a laxative or one or more enemas.
One or more enemas may also be required about 2 hours before a flexible sigmoidoscopy.
Who is at Risk for Stroke?
Some people are at a higher risk for stroke than others.
Unmodifiable risk factors include age, gender, race/ethnicity, and stroke family history.
In contrast, other risk factors for stroke, like high blood pressure or cigarette smoking, can be changed or controlled by the person at risk.
What research is being done for Syringomyelia?
Surgical techniques are also being refined by the neurosurgical research community.
It is also important to understand the role of birth defects in the development of hindbrain malformations that can lead to syringomyelia.
Dietary supplements of folic acid during pregnancy have already been found to reduce the number of cases of certain birth defects.
What Is Asthma?
Asthma AZ-ma is a chronic long-term lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways.
Asthma causes recurring periods of wheezing a whistling sound when you breathe, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing.
The coughing often occurs at night or early in the morning.
When should I start talking with my child?
Start early.
By preschool, most children have seen adults smoking cigarettes or drinking alcohol, either in real life, on TV, or on the Internet.
What is Hydrocephalus?
Hydrocephalus is an excessive buildup of CSF in the brain.
What Are the Signs and Symptoms of a Stroke?
If you think you or someone else is having a TIA or stroke, call 9 - 1 - 1 right away.
Do not drive to the hospital or let someone else drive you.
Call an ambulance so that medical personnel can begin life-saving treatment on the way to the emergency room.
During a stroke, every minute counts.
How can you tell the difference between a cold and the flu?
Because colds and flu share many symptoms, it can be difficult or even impossible to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone.
Special tests that usually must be done within the first few days of illness can be carried out, when needed to tell if a person has the flu.
What are the stages of the disorder?
Stage II, or the rapid destructive stage, usually begins between ages 1 and 4 and may last for weeks or months.
Its onset may be rapid or gradual as the child loses purposeful hand skills and spoken language.
Characteristic hand movements such as wringing, washing, clapping, or tapping, as well as repeatedly moving the hands to the mouth often begin during this stage.
The child may hold the hands clasped behind the back or held at the sides, with random touching, grasping, and releasing.
The movements continue while the child is awake but disappear during sleep.
Breathing irregularities such as episodes of apnea and hyperventilation may occur, although breathing usually improves during sleep.
Some girls also display autistic-like symptoms such as loss of social interaction and communication.
Walking may be unsteady and initiating motor movements can be difficult.
Slowed head growth is usually noticed during this stage.
What kinds of seasonal flu vaccines are available?
However, health care providers should not get the nasal spray vaccine if they are providing medical care for patients who require special environments in the hospital because they are profoundly immunocompromised, for example if they work in bone marrow transplant units.
This is intended as an extra precaution and is not based on reports of vaccine virus transmission in those settings.
The flu shot is preferred for vaccinating health care workers who are in close contact with severely immunocompromised patients who are being cared for in a protective environment.
These health care workers may still get nasal spray vaccine, but they must avoid contact with such patients for 7 days after getting vaccinated.
See Persons Who Live With or Care for Persons at Higher Risk for Influenza-Related Complications for more information.
How can I get enough folic acid?

Lack of iron usually is due to blood loss, poor diet, or an inability to absorb enough iron from food.
Is there any treatment for Multifocal Motor Neuropathy?
Treatment for multifocal motor neuropathy varies.
Some individuals experience only mild, modest symptoms and require no treatment.
For others, treatment generally consists of intravenous immunoglobulin IVIg or immunosuppressive therapy with cyclophosphamide.
What is Broken Heart Syndrome?
Most people who experience broken heart syndrome think they may be having a heart attack, a more common medical emergency caused by a blocked coronary heart artery.
The two conditions have similar symptoms, including chest pain and shortness of breath.
However, there's no evidence of blocked coronary arteries in broken heart syndrome, and most people have a full and quick recovery.
What is Autoimmune hepatitis?
Autoimmune hepatitis is a serious condition that may worsen over time if not treated.
What Causes COPD?
Although uncommon, some people who have asthma can develop COPD.
Asthma is a chronic long-term lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways.
Treatment usually can reverse the inflammation and narrowing.
However, if not, COPD can develop.
How isH.
pylori spread?
Other research is exploring how infection spreads from an infected person to an uninfected person.
Studies suggest that having contact with the stool or vomit of an infected person can spread H.
pylori infection.
And H.
pylori has been found in the saliva of some infected people, which means infection could be spread through direct contact with saliva.
Who Is at Risk for Deep Vein Thrombosis?
Conditions or factors that make your blood thicker or more likely to clot than normal.

It also helps digest food and stores a form of sugar your body uses for energy.
The liver is the largest organ in your body.
What are the risks associated with drinking raw milk?
Many people who chose raw milk thinking they would improve their health instead found themselves or their loved ones sick in a hospital for several weeks fighting for their lives from infections caused by germs in raw milk.
For example, a person can develop severe or even life-threatening diseases, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, which can cause paralysis, and hemolytic uremic syndrome, which can result in kidney failure and stroke.
What Causes Long QT Syndrome?
Long QT syndrome LQTS can be inherited or acquired.
Inherited means you're born with the condition and have it your whole life.
Inherited conditions are passed from parents to children through genes.
Acquired means you aren't born with the condition, but you develop it during your lifetime.
What should you expect before Pulmonary Rehabilitation?
Your PR team also will review your medical therapy to see whether it needs to be changed during the PR program.
For example, you may need to start using, or increase the use of, inhaled bronchodilators.
These medicines can help you breathe easier during exercise.
You also may need oxygen therapy to help you get the most out of your exercise plan.
What Is a Chest X Ray?
A chest x ray is a painless, noninvasive test that creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels.
Noninvasive means that no surgery is done and no instruments are inserted into your body.
Why is vaccination necessary?
However, measles is still common in other countries.
The virus is highly contagious and can spread rapidly in areas where vaccination is not widespread.
It is estimated that in 2006 there were 242,000 measles deaths worldwide - that equals about 663 deaths every day or 27 deaths every hour.
If vaccinations were stopped, measles cases would return to pre-vaccine levels and hundreds of people would die from measles-related illnesses.

What is The GI tract?
The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus.
What Is Sickle Cell Anemia?
Normal red blood cells are disc-shaped and look like doughnuts without holes in the center.
They move easily through your blood vessels.
Red blood cells contain an iron-rich protein called hemoglobin HEE-muh-glow-bin.
This protein carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.
Can Infection with VZV During Pregnancy Harm the Baby?
If a pregnant woman gets chickenpox between 21 to 5 days before giving birth, her newborn can have chickenpox at birth or develop it within a few days.
But the time lapse between the start of the mother's illness and the birth of the baby generally allows the mother's immune system to react and produce antibodies to fight the virus.
These antibodies can be transmitted to the unborn child and thus help fight the infection.
Still, a small percent of the babies exposed to chickenpox in the 21 to 5 days before birth develop shingles in the first 5 years of life because the newborn's immune system is not yet fully functional and capable of keeping the virus latent.
What Treatments Are Available?
Although there is no cure for osteoporosis, several medications are available for the prevention and/or treatment of osteoporosis, including: bisphosphonates; estrogen agonists/antagonists also called selective estrogen receptor modulators or SERMS; calcitonin; parathyroid hormone; estrogen therapy; hormone therapy; and a recently approved RANK ligand RANKL inhibitor.
What is Shingles?
Virtually all adults in the United States have had chickenpox, even if it was so mild as to pass unnoticed, and thus may develop shingles later in life.
In the original exposure to VZV chickenpox, some of the virus particles leave the blood and settle into clusters of nerve cells neurons  called sensory ganglia, where they remain for many years in an inactive latent form.
The sensory ganglia, which are adjacent to the spinal cord and brain, relay information to the brain about what the body is sensing - heat, cold, touch, pain.
What Are the Risks of Stress Testing?
Jitteriness or discomfort while getting medicine to make your heart work hard and beat fast you may be given medicine if you can't exercise.
These side effects usually go away shortly after you stop getting the medicine.
Sometimes the symptoms may last a few hours.
What causes appendicitis?
An obstruction, or blockage, of the appendiceal lumen causes appendicitis.
Mucus backs up in the appendiceal lumen, causing bacteria that normally live inside the appendix to multiply.
As a result, the appendix swells and becomes infected.
Sources of blockage include.
February Is American Heart Month: Are You at Risk for Heart Disease?
Cardiovascular disease CVD - including heart disease, stroke, and high blood pressure - is the number 1 killer of women and men in the United States.

What are the signs of depression?
It's normal to feel sad sometimes, but if you feel sad or 'down' for more than 2 weeks at a time, you may be depressed.
If an athlete or other person with a lot of muscle has a BMI over 25, is that person still considered to be overweight?
It is important to remember, however, that BMI is not a direct measure of body fatness and that BMI is calculated from an individual's weight which includes both muscle and fat.
As a result, some individuals may have a high BMI but not have a high percentage of body fat.
For example, highly trained athletes may have a high BMI because of increased muscularity rather than increased body fatness.
Although some people with a BMI in the overweight range from 25.0 to 29.9 may not have excess body fatness, most people with a BMI in the obese range equal to or greater than 30 will have increased levels of body fatness.
What should you expect before Carotid Ultrasound?

Typically, there is little to do in advance of the test.
Your doctor will tell you how to prepare for your carotid ultrasound.
.
What is Sandhoff Disease?
Sandhoff disease is a rare, genetic, lipid storage disorder resulting in the progressive deterioration of the central nervous system.
It is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme beta-hexosaminidase, which results in the accumulation of certain fats lipids in the brain and other organs of the body.
Sandhoff disease is a severe form of Tay-Sachs disease--which is prevalent primarily in people of Eastern European and Ashkenazi Jewish descent--but it is not limited to any ethnic group.
Onset of the disorder usually occurs at 6 months of age.
Neurological symptoms may include motor weakness, startle reaction to sound, early blindness, progressive mental and motor deterioration, macrocephaly an abnormally enlarged head, cherry-red spots in the eyes, seizures, and myoclonus shock-like contractions of a muscle.
Other symptoms may include frequent respiratory infections, doll-like facial appearance, and an enlarged liver and spleen.
How does dog flu spread?
Canine influenza virus can be spread by direct contact with aerosolized respiratory secretions from infected dogs, by contact with contaminated objects, and by people moving between infected and uninfected dogs.
Therefore, dog owners whose dogs are coughing or showing other signs of respiratory disease should not participate in activities or bring their dogs to facilities where other dogs can be exposed to the virus.
Clothing, equipment, surfaces, and hands should be cleaned and disinfected after exposure to dogs showing signs of respiratory disease.

What are the early signs?
The signs of cerebral palsy usually appear in the early months of life, although specific diagnosis may be delayed until age two years or later.
Infants with CP frequently have developmental delay, in which they are slow to reach developmental milestones such as learning to roll over, sit, crawl, or walk.
Some infants with CP have abnormal muscle tone.
Decreased muscle tone hypotonia can make them appear relaxed, even floppy.
Increased muscle tone hypertonia can make them seem stiff or rigid.
In some cases, an early period of hypotonia will progress to hypertonia after the first 2 to 3 months of life.
Children with CP may also have unusual posture or favor one side of the body when they reach, crawl, or move.
It is important to note that some children without CP also might have some of these signs.

What Does Thoracentesis Show?
Once the cause of the pleural effusion is known, your doctor will talk to you about a treatment plan.
For example, if an infection is the cause, you may need antibiotics to fight the infection.
If the cause is heart failure, you'll be treated for that condition.
Is there any treatment for Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease?
There is no treatment that can cure or control CJD.
Current treatment is aimed at alleviating symptoms and making the patient as comfortable as possible.
Opiate drugs can help relieve pain, and the drugs clonazepam and sodium valproate may help relieve involuntary muscle jerks.
What is Uterine sarcoma?
Uterine sarcoma is a very rare kind of cancer that forms in the uterine muscles or in tissues that support the uterus.
How common is swine flu among pigs?
H1N1 and H3N2 swine flu viruses are endemic among pig populations in the United States and something that the industry deals with routinely.
Outbreaks among pigs normally occur in colder weather months late fall and winter , but can occur year round.
While H1N1 swine viruses have been known to circulate among pig populations since at least 1930, H3N2 influenza viruses did not begin circulating among pigs in the United States until about 1998.
The H3N2 viruses initially were introduced into the pig population from humans.
However, since then the H3N2 viruses circulating in pigs have changed.
The H3N2 viruses circulating in pigs now are very different from the seasonal H3N2 viruses that circulate in humans.

What is Lactose *?
Lactose * is a sugar found in milk and milk products.
What Is Lactose Intolerance?
Lactose intolerance is a common problem.
It happens when your body does not have enough lactase, which is an enzyme produced in the small intestine.
Lactase is necessary to digest lactose - the natural sugar found in milk and other dairy products.
In the intestines, undigested lactose leads to the buildup of gas.
Within 30 minutes to 2 hours after eating dairy products containing lactose, people with lactose intolerance start to develop stomach cramps and diarrhea.
These two symptoms must be present for a person to be diagnosed with lactose intolerance.
What is Adulthood?
Adulthood is a time when we need to look carefully at our bone health.
Where is Bone marrow found?
Bone marrow is found in the center of most bones and has many blood vessels.
How Do You Know if You Have Osteoarthritis?
Although osteoarthritis can occur in any joint, most often it affects the hands, knees, hips, and spine either at the neck or lower back.
Different characteristics of the disease can depend on the specific joints affected.
For general warning signs of osteoarthritis, see the information box 'The Warning Signs of Osteoarthritis.' For information on the joints most often affected by osteoarthritis, see the following descriptions:
What is Tremor?
Essential tremor sometimes called benign essential tremor is the most common form of abnormal tremor.The hands are most often affected but the head, voice, tongue, legs, and trunk may also be involved.
Head tremor may be seen as a yes-yes or no-no motion.
Onset is most common after age 40, although symptoms can appear at any age.
Parkinsonian tremor is caused by damage to structures within the brain that control movement.
The tremor is classically seen as a pill-rolling action of the hands but may also affect the chin, lips, legs, and trunk.
Dystonic tremor occurs in individuals of all ages who are affected by dystonia, a movement disorder in which sustained involuntary muscle contractions cause twisting motions or painful postures or positions.
What should you expect during a Tracheostomy?
The surgeon will place a tube called a trach tube through the hole and into the windpipe.
The tube will help keep the hole open.
Some trach tubes are 'cuffed.' Doctors can widen or narrow cuffed tubes by inflating or deflating them with air.
Can I determine if my child or teen is obese by using an adult BMI calculator?
No.
The adult calculator provides only the BMI number and not the BMI age- and sex-specific percentile that is used to interpret BMI and determine the weight category for children and teens.
It is not appropriate to use the BMI categories for adults to interpret BMI numbers for children and teens.
What do I need to know about Cirrhosis - National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse?

What is Breast cancer?
Breast cancer is the most frequent type of cancer among women and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women.
What is Folic acid?
Folic acid is a B vitamin that helps build healthy red blood cells.
What is a stroke?
A stroke occurs when blood flow is cut off from part of the brain.
In the same way that a person suffering a loss of blood to the heart can be said to be having a heart attack, a person with a loss of blood to the brain can be said to be having a brain attack.
There are two kinds of stroke, hemorrhagic and ischemic.
Hemorrhagic strokes are caused by bleeding within the brain.
Ischemic strokes, which are far more common, are caused by a blockage of blood flow in an artery in the head or neck leading to the brain.
Some ischemic strokes are due to stenosis, or narrowing of arteries due to the build up of plaque, fatty deposits and blood clots along the artery wall.
A vascular disease that can cause stenosis is atherosclerosis, in which deposits of plaque build-up along the inner wall of large and medium-sized arteries, decreasing blood flow.
Atherosclerosis in the carotid arteries, two large arteries in the neck that carry blood to the brain, is a major risk factor for ischemic stroke.
What is the digestive system?
The digestive system is made up of the gastrointestinal GI tract - also called the digestive tract - and the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder.
The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus.
The hollow organs that make up the GI tract are the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine - which includes the colon and rectum - and anus.
Food enters the mouth and passes to the anus through the hollow organs of the GI tract.
The liver, pancreas, and gallbladder are the solid organs of the digestive system.
The digestive system helps the body digest food, which includes breaking food down into nutrients the body needs.
Nutrients are substances the body uses for energy, growth, and cell repair.
What is Physical activity?
Physical activity is an important part of a heart healthy lifestyle.
Is Fluzone High-Dose safe?
The safety profile of Fluzone High-Dose vaccine is similar to that of regular flu vaccines, although some adverse events which are also reported after regular flu vaccines were reported more frequently after vaccination with Fluzone High-Dose.
The most common adverse events experienced during clinical studies were mild and temporary, and included pain, redness and swelling at the injection site, headache, muscle aches, fever and malaise.
Most people had minimal or no adverse events after receiving the Fluzone High-Dose vaccine.
Who Is at Risk for Pulmonary Hypertension?
Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension PAH without a known cause is rare.

Similar estimates have not been made for the other PH groups.
Group 1 PAH affects women more often than men.
People who have group 1 PAH tend to be overweight.
Who Needs Catheter Ablation?
You have faulty electrical activity in your heart that raises your risk of ventricular fibrillation v-fib and sudden cardiac arrest SCA.
V-fib is a life-threatening arrhythmia.
SCA is a condition in which your heart suddenly stops beating.
What Kinds of Rehabilitation Should a TBI Patient Receive?
In 1998, the NIH held a Consensus Development Conference on Rehabilitation of Persons with Traumatic Brain Injury.
The Consensus Development Panel recommended that TBI patients receive an individualized rehabilitation program based upon the patient's strengths and capacities and that rehabilitation services should be modified over time to adapt to the patient's changing needs.* The panel also recommended that moderately to severely injured patients receive rehabilitation treatment that draws on the skills of many specialists.
This involves individually tailored treatment programs in the areas of physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech/language therapy, physiatry physical medicine, psychology/psychiatry, and social support.
Medical personnel who provide this care include rehabilitation specialists, such as rehabilitation nurses, psychologists, speech/language pathologists, physical and occupational therapists, physiatrists physical medicine specialists, social workers, and a team coordinator or administrator.
What is Hemiplegic migraine?
Hemiplegic migraine is a rare but severe form of migraine that causes temporary paralysis-sometimes lasting several days-on one side of the body prior to or during a headache.
Is there any treatment for Guillain-Barre Syndrome?
There is no known cure for Guillain-Barre syndrome, but therapies can lessen the severity of the illness and accelerate the recovery in most patients.
There are also a number of ways to treat the complications of the disease.
Currently, plasmapheresis also known as plasma exchange and high-dose immunoglobulin therapy are used.
Plasmapheresis seems to reduce the severity and duration of the Guillain-Barre episode.
In high-dose immunoglobulin therapy, doctors give intravenous injections of the proteins that in small quantities, the immune system uses naturally to attack invading organism.
Investigators have found that giving high doses of these immunoglobulins, derived from a pool of thousands of normal donors, to Guillain-Barre patients can lessen the immune attack on the nervous system.
The most critical part of the treatment for this syndrome consists of keeping the patient's body functioning during recovery of the nervous system.
This can sometimes require placing the patient on a ventilator, a heart monitor, or other machines that assist body function.
What is Pulmonary embolism PE?
Pulmonary embolism PE is a sudden blockage in a lung artery.
What Causes Diabetic Heart Disease?

What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Atherosclerosis?
Atherosclerosis usually doesn't cause signs and symptoms until it severely narrows or totally blocks an artery.
Many people don't know they have the disease until they have a medical emergency, such as a heart attack or stroke.
What are Swallowing Disorders?
Having trouble swallowing dysphagia is a symptom that accompanies a number of neurological disorders.
The problem can occur at any stage of the normal swallowing process as food and liquid move from the mouth, down the back of the throat, through the esophagus and into the stomach.
Difficulties can range from a total inability to swallow, to coughing or choking because the food or liquid is entering the windpipe, which is referred to as aspiration.
When aspiration is frequent a person can be at risk of developing pneumonia.
Food may get stuck in the throat or individuals may drool because they cannot swallow their saliva.
Neurological conditions that can cause swallowing difficulties are: stroke the most common cause of dysphagia; traumatic brain injury; cerebral palsy; Parkinson disease and other degenerative neurological disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, multiple sclerosis, progressive supranuclear palsy, Huntington disease, and myasthenia gravis.
Muscular dystrophy and myotonic dystrophy are accompanied by dysphagia, which is also the cardinal symptom of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, a rare, progressive genetic disorder.
How does a person prepare for a colonoscopy?
Cleanse the bowel.
The gastroenterologist will give written bowel prep instructions to follow at home.
A gastroenterologist orders a bowel prep so that little to no stool is present inside the person's intestine.
A complete bowel prep lets the person pass stool that is clear.
Stool inside the colon can prevent the gastroenterologist from clearly seeing the lining of the intestine.
Instructions may include following a clear liquid diet for 1 to 3 days before the procedure and avoiding drinks that contain red or purple dye.
The instructions will provide specific direction about when to start and stop the clear liquid diet.
People may drink or eat the following: fat-free bouillon or broth.
What can a person expect after a lower gastrointestinal series?
A person should carefully read and follow the discharge instructions, which will explain how to flush the remaining barium from the intestine.
The radiologist will interpret the images and send a report of the findings to the person's health care provider.
What Causes Varicose Veins?
Weak vein walls may cause weak valves.
Normally, the walls of the veins are elastic stretchy.
If these walls become weak, they lose their normal elasticity.
They become like an overstretched rubber band.
This makes the walls of the veins longer and wider, and it causes the flaps of the valves to separate.
Where Can I Go to Get Screened?
Mammograms are performed at clinics, hospitals, and doctor's offices.
For help scheduling an appointment, call your doctors' office.
Is TS inherited?
Evidence from twin and family studies suggests that TS is an inherited disorder.
Although early family studies suggested an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance an autosomal dominant disorder is one in which only one copy of the defective gene, inherited from one parent, is necessary to produce the disorder, more recent studies suggest that the pattern of inheritance is much more complex.
Although there may be a few genes with substantial effects, it is also possible that many genes with smaller effects and environmental factors may play a role in the development of TS.
What research is being done for Megalencephaly?
The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health NIH conduct research related to megalencephaly in laboratories at the NIH and also support additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country.
Much of this research explores the complex mechanisms of normal brain development.
The knowledge gained from these fundamental studies will provide a foundation for developing ways to prevent megalencephaly and the other cephalic disorders.
Can Scientists Predict or Prevent Parkinson's Disease?
In most cases, there is no way to predict or prevent sporadic PD.
However, researchers are looking for a biomarker - a biological abnormality that all people with PD might share - that could be picked up by screening techniques or by a simple chemical test given to people who do not have any parkinsonian symptoms.
This could help doctors identify people at risk of the disease.
It also might allow them to find treatments that will stop the disease process in the early stages.
What research is being done for Frontotemporal Dementia?
The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS, and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health NIH, conduct research related to FTD in laboratories at the NIH, and also support additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country.
What is the prognosis for Deep Brain Stimulation for Parkinson's Disease?
Although most individuals still need to take medication after undergoing DBS, many people with Parkinson's disease experience considerable reduction of their motor symptoms and are able to reduce their medications.
The amount of reduction varies but can be considerably reduced in most individuals, and can lead to a significant improvement in side effects such as dyskinesias involuntary movements caused by long-term use of levodopa.
In some cases, the stimulation itself can suppress dyskinesias without a reduction in medication.
DBS does not improve cognitive symptoms in PD and indeed may worsen them, so it is not generally used if there are signs of dementia.
DBS changes the brain firing pattern but does not slow the progression of the neurodegeneration.
What is Wilson Disease?
Wilson disease WD is a rare inherited disorder of copper metabolism in which excessive amounts of copper accumulate in the body.
The buildup of copper leads to damage in the liver, brain, and eyes.
Although copper accumulation begins at birth, symptoms of the disorder only appear later in life.
The most characteristic sign of WD is the Kayser-Fleisher ring - a rusty brown ring around the cornea of the eye that can best be viewed using an ophthalmologist's slit lamp.
The primary consequence for most individuals with WD is liver disease, appearing in late childhood or early adolescence as acute hepatitis, liver failure, or progressive chronic liver disease in the form of chronic active hepatitis or cirrhosis of the liver.
In others, the first symptoms are neurological, occur later in adulthood, and commonly include slurred speech dysarthria, difficulty swallowing dysphagia, and drooling.
Other symptoms may include tremor of the head, arms, or legs; impaired muscle tone, and sustained muscle contractions that produce abnormal postures, twisting, and repetitive movements dystonia; and slowness of movements bradykinesia.
Individuals may also experience clumsiness ataxia and loss of fine motor skills.
One-third of individuals with WD will also experience psychiatric symptoms such as an abrupt personality change, bizarre and inappropriate behavior, depression accompanied by suicidal thoughts, neurosis, or psychosis.
WD is diagnosed with tests that measure the amount of copper in the blood, urine, and liver.
What Research is Being Done?
Biological therapy involves enhancing the body's overall immune response to recognize and fight cancer cells.
The immune system is designed to attack foreign substances in the body; since cancer cells aren't foreign, they usually do not generate much of an immune response.
Researchers are using different methods to provoke a strong immune response to tumor cells.
Such proteins as interleukin and interferon, both of which are immune system 'messengers' called cytokines, and other substances can stimulate and restore the body's natural response against proteins on the surfaces of cancer cells and thus slow tumor growth.
Other therapy uses viruses, T-cells a major component of immune system function, and other substances to increase immune response and target the tumor cells.
Scientists are also experimenting with genetically altered T-cells from the patient's own body, which are cultured with an antigen and injected directly into the brain following surgery.
Biological therapies to fight CNS tumors include vaccines, gene therapy, antibody therapy, and tumor growth factors.
How is transverse myelitis treated?
As with many disorders of the spinal cord, no effective cure currently exists for people with transverse myelitis.
Treatments are designed to reduce spinal cord inflammation and manage and alleviate symptoms.
Physicians often prescribe anti-inflammatory corticosteroid therapy soon after the diagnosis is made in order to decrease inflammation and hopefully improve the chances and speed of neurological recovery.
Although no clinical trials have investigated whether corticosteroids alter the course of transverse myelitis, these drugs often are prescribed to reduce immune system activity because of the suspected autoimmune mechanisms involved in the disorder.
Corticosteroid medications that might be prescribed may include intravenous methylprednisone or dexamethasone usually for about 5 days; in some cases, oral prednisone is used for a period of time afterwards.
In severe cases that do not appear to respond to corticosteroid treatment, other therapies such as plasma exchange or drug therapies may be used to try to salvage neurological function.
General painkillers may be prescribed for any pain the patient may have.
And bed rest is often recommended during the initial days and weeks after onset of the disorder.

Is thimerosal in vaccines linked to autism?
Numerous studies have found no association between thimerosal exposure and autism.
CDC places a high priority on vaccine safety, surveillance, and research.
CDC is aware that the presence of the preservative thimerosal in vaccines and allegations of a relationship to autism have raised public concerns.
These concerns have made decisions surrounding vaccinations confusing and difficult for some people.
Since 2001, no new vaccine licensed by FDA for use in children has contained thimerosal as a preservative and all vaccines routinely recommended by CDC for children younger than 6 years of age have been thimerosal-free, or contain only trace amounts of thimerosal, except for some formulations of influenza vaccine.
Unfortunately, reductions in the numbers of children identified with autism have not been observed indicating that the cause of autism is not related to a single exposure such as thimerosal.
Is there any treatment for Sturge-Weber Syndrome?
Treatment for Sturge-Weber syndrome is symptomatic.
Laser treatment may be used to lighten or remove the birthmark.
Anticonvulsant medications may be used to control seizures.

What happens to the digested food molecules?
The small intestine absorbs most digested food molecules, as well as water and minerals, and passes them on to other parts of the body for storage or further chemical change.
Specialized cells help absorbed materials cross the intestinal lining into the bloodstream.
The bloodstream carries simple sugars, amino acids, glycerol, and some vitamins and salts to the liver.
The lymphatic system, a network of vessels that carry white blood cells and a fluid called lymph throughout the body, absorbs fatty acids and vitamins.

What is the prognosis for Stroke?
Although stroke is a disease of the brain, it can affect the entire body.
A common disability that results from stroke is complete paralysis on one side of the body, called hemiplegia.
A related disability that is not as debilitating as paralysis is one-sided weakness or hemiparesis.
Stroke may cause problems with thinking, awareness, attention, learning, judgment, and memory.
Stroke survivors often have problems understanding or forming speech.
A stroke can lead to emotional problems.
Stroke patients may have difficulty controlling their emotions or may express inappropriate emotions.
Many stroke patients experience depression.
Stroke survivors may also have numbness or strange sensations.
The pain is often worse in the hands and feet and is made worse by movement and temperature changes, especially cold temperatures.

It's common in many countries, including those in Central and South America.
Is there any treatment for Krabbe Disease?
There is no cure for Krabbe disease.
Results of a very small clinical trial of patients with infantile Krabbe disease found that children who received umbilical cord blood stem cells from unrelated donors prior to symptom onset developed with little neurological impairment.
Results also showed that disease progression stabilized faster in patients who receive cord blood compared to those who receive adult bone marrow.
Bone marrow transplantation has been shown to benefit mild cases early in the course of the disease.
Generally, treatment for the disorder is symptomatic and supportive.
Physical therapy may help maintain or increase muscle tone and circulation.
What is Heart failure?
Heart failure is a condition in which the heart is damaged or weak.
Is there any treatment for Myoclonus?

How Does a Person Decide Whether to be Tested?
Some individuals choose to undergo the test out of a desire for greater certainty about their genetic status.
They believe the test will enable them to make more informed decisions about the future.
Others choose not to take the test.
They are able to make peace with the uncertainty of being at risk, preferring to forego the emotional consequences of a positive result, as well as possible losses of insurance and employment.
There is no right or wrong decision, as each choice is highly individual.

What Disabilities Can Result From a TBI?
Most TBI patients have emotional or behavioral problems that fit under the broad category of psychiatric health.
Family members of TBI patients often find that personality changes and behavioral problems are the most difficult disabilities to handle.
Psychiatric problems that may surface include depression, apathy, anxiety, irritability, anger, paranoia, confusion, frustration, agitation, insomnia or other sleep problems, and mood swings.
Problem behaviors may include aggression and violence, impulsivity, disinhibition, acting out, noncompliance, social inappropriateness, emotional outbursts, childish behavior, impaired self-control, impaired self awareness, inability to take responsibility or accept criticism, egocentrism, inappropriate sexual activity, and alcohol or drug abuse/addiction.
Some patients' personality problems may be so severe that they are diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, a psychiatric condition characterized by many of the problems mentioned above.
Sometimes TBI patients suffer from developmental stagnation, meaning that they fail to mature emotionally, socially, or psychologically after the trauma.
This is a serious problem for children and young adults who suffer from a TBI.
Attitudes and behaviors that are appropriate for a child or teenager become inappropriate in adulthood.
Many TBI patients who show psychiatric or behavioral problems can be helped with medication and psychotherapy.

What is Sturge-Weber Syndrome?
Sturge-Weber syndrome is a neurological disorder indicated at birth by a port-wine stain birthmark on the forehead and upper eyelid of one side of the face.
The birthmark can vary in color from light pink to deep purple and is caused by an overabundance of capillaries around the trigeminal nerve just beneath the surface of the face.
Sturge-Weber syndrome is also accompanied by abnormal blood vessels on the brain surface and the loss of nerve cells and calcification of underlying tissue in the cerebral cortex of the brain on the same side of the brain as the birthmark.
Neurological symptoms include seizures that begin in infancy and may worsen with age.
Convulsions usually happen on the side of the body opposite the birthmark and vary in severity.
There may be intermittent or permanent muscle weakness on the same side.
Some children will have developmental delays and mental retardation; most will have glaucoma increased pressure within the eye at birth or developing later.
The increased pressure within the eye can cause the eyeball to enlarge and bulge out of its socket buphthalmos.
There is an increased risk for migraine headaches.
Sturge-Weber syndrome rarely affects other body organs.

What is Giardiasis?
Giardiasis is a diarrheal disease caused by the microscopic parasite Giardia.
Is there any treatment for Sleep Apnea?
There are a variety of treatments for sleep apnea, depending on an individual's medical history and the severity of the disorder.
Most treatment regimens begin with lifestyle changes, such as avoiding alcohol and medications that relax the central nervous system for example, sedatives and muscle relaxants, losing weight, and quitting smoking.
Some people are helped by special pillows or devices that keep them from sleeping on their backs, or oral appliances to keep the airway open during sleep.
If these conservative methods are inadequate, doctors often recommend continuous positive airway pressure CPAP, in which a face mask is attached to a tube and a machine that blows pressurized air into the mask and through the airway to keep it open.
Also available are machines that offer variable positive airway pressure VPAP and automatic positive airway pressure APAP.
There are also surgical procedures that can be used to remove tissue and widen the airway.
Some individuals may need a combination of therapies to successfully treat their sleep apnea.

This pain may be accompanied by red and tearing eyes, a drooping or swollen eyelid on the affected side of the face, and nasal congestion.
Patients may also feel dull pain, soreness, or tenderness between attacks.
Attacks of paroxysmal hemicrania typically occur from 5 to 40 times per day and last 2 to 30 minutes.
The disorder has two forms: chronic, in which patients experience attacks on a daily basis for a year or more, and episodic, in which the headaches may remit for months or years.
Certain movements of the head or neck or external pressure to the neck may trigger these headaches in some patients.
The disorder is more common in women than in men.
Expecting trick-or-treaters or party guests?
Keep candle-lit jack o'lanterns and luminaries away from doorsteps, walkways, landings, and curtains.
Place them on sturdy tables, keep them out of the reach of pets and small children, and never leave them unattended.
What is An upper GI endoscopy?
An upper GI endoscopy is a procedure that uses an endoscope - a small, flexible tube with a light - to see the lining of the upper GI tract.
How Is an Aneurysm Diagnosed?
If you have an abdominal aortic aneurysm AAA, your doctor may feel a throbbing mass in your abdomen.
A rapidly growing aneurysm about to rupture burst can be tender and very painful when pressed.
If you're overweight or obese, it may be hard for your doctor to feel even a large AAA.
How are hemorrhoids diagnosed?
Colonoscopy.
A flexible, lighted tube called a colonoscope is inserted through the anus, the rectum, and the upper part of the large intestine, called the colon.
The colonoscope transmits images of the inside of the rectum and the entire colon.
What Causes Thalassemias?
Thalassemias are inherited disorders - that is, they're passed from parents to children through genes.
People who inherit faulty hemoglobin genes from one parent but normal genes from the other are called carriers.
Carriers often have no signs of illness other than mild anemia.
However, they can pass the faulty genes on to their children.
What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Anemia?
The most common symptom of anemia is fatigue feeling tired or weak.
If you have anemia, you may find it hard to find the energy to do normal activities.
What is Neonatal hemochromatosis?
Neonatal hemochromatosis is a rare disease characterized by liver failure and death in fetuses and newborns.
Who should be tested for hemochromatosis?
Some researchers have suggested widespread screening for the C282Y mutation in the general population.
However, screening is not cost-effective.
Although the C282Y mutation occurs quite frequently, the disease caused by the mutation is rare, and many people with two copies of the mutation never develop iron overload or organ damage.
What is Krabbe disease?
Krabbe disease is a rare, inherited degenerative disorder of the central and peripheral nervous systems.
What are the types of strokes?
A stroke can occur in two ways.
In an ischemic stroke, a blood clot blocks or plugs a blood vessel or artery in the brain.
About 80 percent of all strokes are ischemic.
In an hemorrhagic stroke, a blood vessel in the brain breaks and bleeds into the brain.
About 20 percent of strokes are hemorrhagic.
What is Myotonia Congenita?
Myotonia congenita is an inherited neuromuscular disorder characterized by the inability of muscles to quickly relax after a voluntary contraction.
The condition is present from early childhood, but symptoms can be mild.
Most children will be 2 or 3 years old when parents first notice their muscle stiffness, particularly in the legs, often provoked by sudden activity after rest.
The disease doesn't cause muscle wasting; in fact, it may cause muscle enlargement.
Muscle strength is increased.
There are two forms of the disorder: Becker-type, which is the most common form; and Thomsen's disease, which is a rare and milder form.
The disorder is cause by mutations in a gene responsible for shutting off electrical excitation in the muscles.
Is there any treatment for Postural Tachycardia Syndrome?
Therapies for POTS are targeted at relieving low blood volume or regulating circulatory problems that could be causing the disorder.
No single treatment has been found to be effect for all.
A number of drugs seem to be effective in the short term.
Whether they help in long term is uncertain.
Simple interventions such as adding extra salt to the diet and attention to adequate fluid intake are often effective.
The drugs fludrocortisone for those on a high salt diet and midodrine in low doses are often used to increase blood volume and narrow blood vessels.
Drinking 16 ounces of water 2 glassfuls before getting up can also help raise blood pressure.
Some individuals are helped by beta receptor blocking agents.
There is some evidence that an exercise program can gradually improve orthostatic tolerance.
How is Wilson disease diagnosed?
Health care providers typically see the same symptoms of Wilson disease in other conditions, and the symptoms of Wilson disease do not occur together often, making the disease difficult to diagnose.

Visitors to the website will find information about the basics of participating in a clinical trial, first-hand stories from actual clinical trial volunteers, explanations from researchers, and links to how to search for a trial or enroll in a research-matching program.
Are other conditions associated with Chiari malformations?
Syringomyelia, or hydromyelia, is a disorder in which a CSF-filled tubular cyst, or syrinx, forms within the spinal cord's central canal.
The growing syrinx destroys the center of the spinal cord, resulting in pain, weakness, and stiffness in the back, shoulders, arms, or legs.
Other symptoms may include headaches and a loss of the ability to feel extremes of hot or cold, especially in the hands.
Some individuals also have severe arm and neck pain.
What is Cetuximab Cetuximab?
Cetuximab Cetuximab is a partially humanized monoclonal antibody against the epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR.
Is there any treatment for Pompe Disease?
Individuals with Pompe disease are best treated by a team of specialists such as cardiologist, neurologist, and respiratory therapist knowledgeable about the disease, who can offer supportive and symptomatic care.
The discovery of the GAA gene has led to rapid progress in understanding the biological mechanisms and properties of the GAA enzyme.
As a result, an enzyme replacement therapy has been developed that has shown, in clinical trials with infantile-onset patients, to decrease heart size, maintain normal heart function, improve muscle function, tone, and strength, and reduce glycogen accumulation.
A drug called alglucosidase alfa Myozyme, has received FDA approval for the treatment of infants and children with Pompe disease.
Another algluosidase alfa drug, Lumizyme, has been approved for late-onset non-infantile Pompe disease.
How are spinal cord injuries classified?
Once the swelling from within and around the spinal cord has eased a bit - usually within a week to 10 days - physicians will conduct a complete neurological exam to classify the injury as complete or incomplete.
An incomplete injury means that the ability of the spinal cord to convey messages to or from the brain is not completely lost.
People with incomplete injuries retain some sensory function and may have voluntary motor activity below the injury site.
A complete injury prevents nerve communications from the brain and spinal cord to parts of the body below the injury site.
There is a total lack of sensory and motor function below the level of injury, even if the spinal cord was not completely severed.
Studies have shown that people with incomplete injuries have a greater chance of recovering some function in the affected limbs than those with a complete injury.
What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Atelectasis?
If atelectasis affects a large area of lung, especially if it occurs suddenly, it may cause a low level of oxygen in your blood.
As a result, you may feel short of breath.
Your heart rate and breathing rate may increase, and your skin and lips may turn blue.

My Daughter Is Constantly Dieting.
Should I Be Concerned?
You should discuss your concerns with your daughter's doctor.
If your daughter is one of up to 3 percent of American girls and young women with eating disorders, the problem is even more serious.
Eating disorders, especially anorexia nervosa, can lead to missed or irregular menstrual periods or the complete absence of periods, known as amenorrhea.
These are signs of low estrogen, a hormone that is essential for developing bone density and reaching peak bone mass.
Girls with anorexia nervosa will often have fractures as a first sign of the disease.
Furthermore, reduction in estrogen production in adolescence can increase your daughter's risk of osteoporosis and fracture later in life.
In severe cases, girls with eating disorders may even develop osteoporosis in their twenties, and they may find the damage to their bones cannot be reversed later in life.
What are the symptoms of UC?
Most people diagnosed with UC have mild to moderate symptoms.
About 10 percent have severe symptoms such as frequent fevers, bloody diarrhea, nausea, and severe abdominal cramps.
UC can also cause problems such as joint pain, eye irritation, kidney stones, liver disease, and osteoporosis.
Scientists do not know why these problems occur, but they think these complications may be the result of inflammation triggered by the immune system.
Some of these problems go away when UC is treated.
What is Gerstmann's Syndrome?
There are few reports of the syndrome, sometimes called developmental Gerstmann's syndrome, in children.
The cause is not known.
Most cases are identified when children reach school age, a time when they are challenged with writing and math exercises.
Generally, children with the disorder exhibit poor handwriting and spelling skills, and difficulty with math functions, including adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing.
An inability to differentiate right from left and to discriminate among individual fingers may also be apparent.
In addition to the four primary symptoms, many children also suffer from constructional apraxia, an inability to copy simple drawings.
Frequently, there is also an impairment in reading.
Children with a high level of intellectual functioning as well as those with brain damage may be affected with the disorder.
Are There Special Issues for African American Women Regarding Bone Health?
As many as 75 percent of all African Americans are lactose intolerant.
Lactose intolerance can hinder optimal calcium intake.
People with lactose intolerance often may avoid milk and other dairy products that are excellent sources of calcium because they have trouble digesting lactose, the primary sugar in milk.

An aortogram is an angiogram of the aorta.
What is Paroxysmal Choreoathetosis?
Paroxysmal choreoathetosis is a movement disorder characterized by episodes or attacks of involuntary movements of the limbs, trunk, and facial muscles.
The disorder may occur in several members of a family, or in only a single family member.
Prior to an attack some individuals experience tightening of muscles or other physical symptoms.
Involuntary movements precipitate some attacks, and other attacks occur when the individual has consumed alcohol or caffeine, or is tired or stressed.
Attacks can last from 10 seconds to over an hour.
Some individuals have lingering muscle tightness after an attack.
Paroxysmal choreoathetosis frequently begins in early adolescence.
A gene associated with the disorder has been discovered.
The same gene is also associated with epilepsy.
What research is being done for Holoprosencephaly?
The NINDS supports and conducts a wide range of studies that focus on identifying and learning more about the factors involved in normal brain development.
Recent research has identified specific genes that cause holoprosencephaly.
The knowledge gained from these fundamental studies provides the foundation for understanding how to develop new ways to treat, and potentially prevent, this disorder.
How are meningitis and encephalitis diagnosed?
Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord can detect infections in the brain and/or spinal cord, acute and chronic inflammation, and other diseases.
In a procedure known as a spinal tap or lumbar puncture, a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid is removed by a special needle that is inserted into the lower back.
The skin is anesthetized with a local anesthetic prior to the sampling.
The fluid, which is completely clear in healthy people, is tested to detect the presence of bacteria or blood, as well as to measure glucose levels a low glucose level can be seen in bacterial or fungal meningitis and white blood cells elevated white blood cell counts are also a sign of infection.
The procedure is done in a hospital and takes about 45 minutes.The individual will most often be placed on antibiotics and an antiviral drug while awaiting the final microbiology results as delay in treatment can be life-threatening.
What is Parry-Romberg?
Parry-Romberg syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by slowly progressive deterioration atrophy of the skin and soft tissues of half of the face hemifacial atrophy, usually the left side.
It is more common in females than in males.
Initial facial changes usually involve the tissues above the upper jaw maxilla or between the nose and the upper corner of the lip nasolabial fold and subsequently progress to the angle of the mouth, areas around the eye, the brow, the ear, and the neck.
The deterioration may also affect the tongue, the soft and fleshy part of the roof of the mouth, and the gums.
The eye and cheek of the affected side may become sunken and facial hair may turn white and fall out alopecia.
In addition, the skin overlying affected areas may become darkly pigmented hyperpigmentation with, in some cases, areas of hyperpigmentation and patches of unpigmented skin vitiligo.
Parry-Romberg syndrome is also accompanied by neurological abnormalities including seizures and episodes of severe facial pain trigeminal neuralgia.
The onset of the disease usually begins between the ages of 5 and 15 years.
The progression of the atrophy often lasts from 2 to 10 years, and then the process seems to enter a stable phase.
Muscles in the face may atrophy and there may be bone loss in the facial bones.
Problems with the retina and optic nerve may occur when the disease surrounds the eye.
What is A healthy diet?
A healthy diet is an important part of a healthy lifestyle.

What is Cardiac catheterization?
Cardiac catheterization is a procedure used to diagnose and treat certain heart conditions.
What is Dandy-Walker Syndrome?
Dandy-Walker Syndrome is a congenital brain malformation involving the cerebellum an area at the back of the brain that controls movement and the fluid-filled spaces around it.
The key features of this syndrome are an enlargement of the fourth ventricle a small channel that allows fluid to flow freely between the upper and lower areas of the brain and spinal cord, a partial or complete absence of the area of the brain between the two cerebellar hemispheres cerebellar vermis, and cyst formation near the lowest part of the skull.
An increase in the size of the fluid spaces surrounding the brain as well as an increase in pressure may also be present.
What is Alzheimer's Disease?
Alzheimer's disease AD is an age-related, non-reversible brain disorder that develops over a period of years.
Initially, people experience memory loss and confusion, which may be mistaken for the kinds of memory changes that are sometimes associated with normal aging.
However, the symptoms of AD gradually lead to behavior and personality changes, a decline in cognitive abilities such as decision-making and language skills, and problems recognizing family and friends.
AD ultimately leads to a severe loss of mental function.
These losses are related to the worsening breakdown of the connections between certain neurons in the brain and their eventual death.
AD is one of a group of disorders called dementias that are characterized by cognitive and behavioral problems.
It is the most common cause of dementia among people age 65 and older.
What is A coronary calcium scan?

The disease occurs in about 1 out of every 500 African American births.
Sickle cell anemia also affects Hispanic Americans.
The disease occurs in more than 1 out of every 36,000 Hispanic American births.
What is Neurotoxicity?
Neurotoxicity occurs when the exposure to natural or manmade toxic substances neurotoxicants alters the normal activity of the nervous system.
This can eventually disrupt or even kill neurons, key cells that transmit and process signals in the brain and other parts of the nervous system.
Neurotoxicity can result from exposure to substances used in chemotherapy, radiation treatment, drug therapies, and organ transplants, as well as exposure to heavy metals such as lead and mercury, certain foods and food additives, pesticides, industrial and/or cleaning solvents, cosmetics, and some naturally occurring substances.
Symptoms may appear immediately after exposure or be delayed.
They may include limb weakness or numbness; loss of memory, vision, and/or intellect; headache; cognitive and behavioral problems; and sexual dysfunction.
Individuals with certain disorders may be especially vulnerable to neurotoxicants.
What is Secondhand smoke?
Secondhand smoke is a mixture of gases and fine particles.
Are There Any Special Issues for Asian Women Regarding Bone Health?
Compared with Caucasian women, Asian women have been found to consume less calcium.
One reason for this may be that up to 90 percent of Asian Americans are lactose intolerant.
Therefore, they may avoid dairy products, the primary source of calcium in the diet.
Calcium is essential for building and maintaining a healthy skeleton.
How Is Vasculitis Diagnosed?
Your doctor will diagnose vasculitis based on your signs and symptoms, your medical history, a physical exam, and test results.

Another commonly used scale is the Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale MDS-UPDRS.
This four-part scale measures motor movement in PD: non-motor experiences of daily living, motor experiences of daily living, motor examination, and motor complications.
Both the Hoehn and Yahr scale and the MDS-UPDRS are used to describe how individuals are faring and help to assess how much treatments are helping them.
What if I've been diagnosed with Chagas disease but have a normal EKG?
If you have been diagnosed with Chagas disease, your doctor may perform an electrocardiogram EKG or ECG to check for any problems with the electrical activity of your heart.
Even if this test is normal, you still may need to be given antiparasitic medication used to treat Chagas disease.
Your physician may wish to review CDC's recommendations for evaluation and treatment for more information.
How Can Broken Heart Syndrome Be Prevented?
Also, some of the ways people cope with stress - such as drinking, smoking, or overeating - aren't healthy.

However, people with bloody diarrhea - a sign of bacterial or parasitic infection - should not use these medications.
If diarrhea is caused by bacteria or parasites, over-the-counter medications may prolong the problem.
Medications to treat diarrhea in adults can be dangerous for infants and children and should only be given with a health care provider's guidance.
What kind of genetic changes are included in H5N1 inventory?
Genetic changes occur that affect the amino acid sequence of the proteins of the viruses.
These changes in amino acids affect properties of proteins - such as hemagglutinin HA or neuraminidase NA, the surface proteins of influenza viruses.
Genetic changes in amino acids - the substitution of one amino acid for another - can affect the properties of a virus such as how well a virus grows, how well it transmits between hosts or its susceptibility to antiviral drugs.
Influenza researchers conduct a range of studies that look at how genetic changes influence certain properties of H5N1 influenza viruses.
The inventory of amino acid changes in H5N1 influenza viruses helps researchers identify amino acid sequences that may increase pandemic potential.
How is it diagnosed?
The most common screening methods used to look for spina bifida during pregnancy are second trimester 16-18 weeks of gestation maternal serum alpha fetoprotein MSAFP screening and fetal ultrasound.
The MSAFP screen measures the level of a protein called alpha-fetoprotein AFP, which is made naturally by the fetus and placenta.
During pregnancy, a small amount of AFP normally crosses the placenta and enters the mother's bloodstream.
If abnormally high levels of this protein appear in the mother's bloodstream, it may indicate that the fetus has an 'open' not skin-covered neural tube defect.
The MSAFP test, however, is not specific for spina bifida and requires correct gestational dates to be most accurate; it cannot definitively determine that there is a problem with the fetus.
If a high level of AFP is detected, the doctor may request additional testing, such as an ultrasound or amniocentesis to help determine the cause.
Who Should Not be Vaccinated?
What if we stopped vaccinating for this disease?

What is A recurrent brain tumor?
A recurrent brain tumor is a tumor that has recurred come back after it has been treated.
How do people get Chagas disease?
People can become infected in various ways.
In Chagas disease-endemic areas, the main way is through vectorborne transmission.
The insect vectors are called triatomine bugs.
These blood-sucking bugs get infected by biting an infected animal or person.
Once infected, the bugs pass T.
cruzi parasites in their feces.
The bugs are found in houses made from materials such as mud, adobe, straw, and palm thatch.
During the day, the bugs hide in crevices in the walls and roofs.
During the night, when the inhabitants are sleeping, the bugs emerge.
Because they tend to feed on people's faces, triatomine bugs are also known as kissing bugs.
 After they bite and ingest blood, they defecate on the person.
The person can become infected if T.
cruzi parasites in the bug feces enter the body through mucous membranes or breaks in the skin.
The unsuspecting, sleeping person may accidentally scratch or rub the feces into the bite wound, eyes, or mouth.
How do I know which screening tests to get?
Different screening tests are needed at different ages.
Check the screening guidelines below for your age and sex.
Use these guidelines to start a conversation with your doctor about screening.

What do I need to know about diarrhea - National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse?
is frequent, loose, and watery bowel movements.
Bowel movements, also called stools, are body wastes passed through the rectum and anus .
Stools contain what is left after your digestive system absorbs nutrients and fluids from what you eat and drink.
If your body does not absorb the fluids, or if your digestive system produces extra fluids, stools will be loose and watery.
Loose stools contain more water, salts, and minerals and weigh more than solid stools.
Diarrhea that lasts a short time is called acute diarrhea.
Acute diarrhea is a common problem and usually lasts only 1 or 2 days, but it may last longer.
Diarrhea that lasts for at least 4 weeks is called chronic diarrhea.
Chronic diarrhea symptoms may be continual or they may come and go.

For girls who have already reached puberty when they develop anorexia, menstrual periods are often infrequent or absent.
How is PAP therapy also used?
PAP therapy also is used to treat obstructive sleep apnea.
What is the prognosis for Inflammatory Myopathies?
Most cases of dermatomyositis respond to therapy.
The prognosis for polymyositis varies.
Most individuals respond fairly well to therapy, but some people have a more severe disease that does not respond adequately to therapies and are left with significant disability.
IBM is generally resistant to all therapies and its rate of progression appears to be unaffected by currently available treatments.
How Is Hemolytic Anemia Diagnosed?
Your doctor will diagnose hemolytic anemia based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and test results.
What should you expect before Transesophageal Echocardiography?

Complications of ostomy surgery of the bowel may include.
What is the prognosis for Autism?
For many children, autism symptoms improve with treatment and with age.
Some children with autism grow up to lead normal or near-normal lives.
Children whose language skills regress early in life, usually before the age of 3, appear to be at risk of developing epilepsy or seizure-like brain activity.
During adolescence, some children with autism may become depressed or experience behavioral problems.
Parents of these children should be ready to adjust treatment for their child as needed.
People with an ASD usually continue to need services and support as they get older but many are able to work successfully and live independently or within a supportive environment.
What is A colostomy?
A colostomy is a stoma created from a part of the colon.
Who gets this disorder?
The number of people who develop hydrocephalus or who are currently living with it is difficult to establish since the condition occurs in children and adults, and can develop later in life.
A 2008 data review by the University of Utah found that, in 2003, hydrocephalus accounted for 0.6 percent of all pediatric hospital admissions in the United States.
Some estimates report one to two of every 1,000 babies are born with hydrocephalus.
What are Pervasive Developmental Disorders?
The diagnostic category of pervasive developmental disorders PDD refers to a group of disorders characterized by delays in the development of socialization and communication skills.
Parents may note symptoms as early as infancy, although the typical age of onset is before 3 years of age.
Symptoms may include problems with using and understanding language; difficulty relating to people, objects, and events; unusual play with toys and other objects; difficulty with changes in routine or familiar surroundings, and repetitive body movements or behavior patterns.
Autism a developmental brain disorder characterized by impaired social interaction and communication skills, and a limited range of activities and interests is the most characteristic and best studied PDD.
Other types of PDD include Asperger's Syndrome, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder, and Rett's Syndrome.
Children with PDD vary widely in abilities, intelligence, and behaviors.
Some children do not speak at all, others speak in limited phrases or conversations, and some have relatively normal language development.
Repetitive play skills and limited social skills are generally evident.
Unusual responses to sensory information, such as loud noises and lights, are also common.

Despite this ban, such turtles are still found in some pet stores, flea markets, with street vendors, or sold over the Internet.
In addition, children still catch wild turtles and lizards and bring them home to keep as pets.
Whether purchased or caught in a backyard, a reptile or amphibian can carry Salmonella and might not be the best choice of a pet for your family, especially if there are young children or persons with weakened immune systems in the household.
Why is developmental screening important?
When a developmental delay is not recognized early, children must wait to get the help they need.
This can make it hard for them to learn when they start school.
In the United States, 13 percent of children have a developmental or behavioral disability such as autism, intellectual disability also known as mental retardation, or Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder ADHD.
In addition, many children have delays in language or other areas.
But, less than half of children with problems are identified before starting school.
During this time, the child could have received help for these problems and may even have entered school more ready to learn.

These causes can be inherited or acquired.
Inherited means your parents passed the gene for the condition on to you.
Acquired means you aren't born with the condition, but you develop it.
What Are the Symptoms?
In the early stages of osteonecrosis, people may not have any symptoms.
As the disease progresses, however, most experience joint pain.
At first, the pain occurs only when putting weight on the affected joint.
Later, it occurs even when resting.
Pain usually develops gradually, and may be mild or severe.
If osteonecrosis progresses and the bone and surrounding joint surface collapse, pain may develop or increase dramatically.
Pain may be severe enough to limit range of motion in the affected joint.
In some cases, particularly those involving the hip, disabling osteoarthritis may develop.
The period between the first symptoms and loss of joint function is different for each person, but it typically ranges from several months to more than a year.
What is Holmes-Adie syndrome ?
Holmes-Adie syndrome HAS is a neurological disorder affecting the pupil of the eye and the autonomic nervous system.
It is characterized by one eye with a pupil that is larger than normal and constricts slowly in bright light tonic pupil, along with the absence of deep tendon reflexes, usually in the Achilles tendon.
HAS is thought to be the result of a neurotrophic acting on neurons, or nerve cells viral infection that causes inflammation and damage to neurons in the ciliary ganglion, an area of the brain that controls eye movements, and the dorsal root ganglion, an area of the spinal cord involved in the response of the autonomic nervous system.
HAS begins gradually in one eye, and often progresses to involve the other eye.
At first, it may only cause the loss of deep tendon reflexes on one side of the body, but then progress to the other side.
The eye and reflex symptoms may not appear at the same time.
People with HAS may also sweat excessively, sometimes only on one side of the body.
The combination of these 3 symptoms - abnormal pupil size, loss of deep tendon reflexes, and excessive sweating - is usually called Ross's syndrome, although some doctors will still diagnose the condition as a variant of HAS.
Some individuals will also have cardiovascular abnormalities.
The HAS symptoms can appear on their own, or in association with other diseases of the nervous system, such as Sjogren's syndrome or migraine.
It is most often seen in young women.
It is rarely an inherited condition.

How is a flexible sigmoidoscopy performed?
For the test, the person will lie on a table while the health care provider inserts a sigmoidoscope into the anus and slowly guides it through the rectum and into the sigmoid colon.
The scope inflates the large intestine with air to give the health care provider a better view.
The camera sends a video image of the intestinal lining to a computer screen, allowing the health care provider to examine the tissues lining the sigmoid colon and rectum.
The health care provider may ask the person to move several times so he or she can adjust the scope for better viewing.
Once the scope has reached the transverse colon, the health care provider withdraws it slowly while examining the lining of the colon again.
How is fecal incontinence diagnosed?
The person may be referred to a doctor who specializes in problems of the digestive system, such as a gastroenterologist, proctologist, or colorectal surgeon, or a doctor who specializes in problems of the urinary and reproductive systems, such as a urologist or urogynecologist.
The specialist will perform a physical exam and may suggest one or more of the following tests:

PV is rare in children and young adults.
Men are at slightly higher risk for PV than women.
What is Psychogenic Movement?
Psychogenic movement is an unwanted muscle movement such as a spasm or tremor that is caused by an underlying psychological condition.
Psychogenic movement can involve any part of the body and resemble the same muscle movements that occur with a biological condition or structural abnormality.
Most psychogenic movement is involuntary - done without being consciously initiated by the individual.
Psychogenic movement may develop as part of a conversion disorder in which a psychological event causes physical symptoms with no known medical cause.
It also may result from a somatoform disorder characterized predominantly by multi-system symptoms that are associated with distress and/or dysfunction, factitious disorder an illness that simulates symptoms for psychological reasons, or malingering not characterized as a psychiatric disorder but where illness is pretended as a way to achieve a secondary goal such as the acquisition of drugs or disability benefits.
Unlike movement disorders caused by biological or structural conditions, psychogenic movement disorders commonly develop suddenly, progress rapidly to maximum severity, may increase in intensity, and come and go with complete or partial remissions.
The movement may be less when the person is distracted, and the severity of symptoms varies among individuals.
The course of the psychological condition may be short-lived or lead to chronic disability.
What Is Coronary Angiography?

What are the rectum and colon?
The rectum and colon are part of the gastrointestinal GI tract, a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus - a 1-inch-long opening through which stool leaves the body.
The body digests food using the movement of muscles in the GI tract, along with the release of hormones and enzymes.
Organs that make up the GI tract are the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine - which includes the appendix, cecum, colon, and rectum - and anus.
The intestines are sometimes called the bowel.
The last part of the GI tract - called the lower GI tract - consists of the large intestine and anus.

How does smoking affect peptic ulcers?
Researchers are studying how smoking contributes to peptic ulcers.
Studies suggest that smoking increases the risk of H.
pylori infection, slows the healing of peptic ulcers, and increases the likelihood that peptic ulcers will recur.
The stomach and duodenum contain acids, enzymes, and other substances that help digest food.
However, these substances may also harm the lining of these organs.
Smoking has not been shown to increase acid production.
However, smoking does increase the production of other substances that may harm the lining, such as pepsin, an enzyme made in the stomach that breaks down proteins.
Smoking also decreases factors that protect or heal the lining, including.

What is the prognosis for Paraneoplastic Syndromes?
There are no cures for paraneoplastic syndromes.
There are no available treatments to stop progressive neurological damage.
Generally, the stage of cancer at diagnosis determines the outcome.
What Causes Juvenile Arthritis?
Most forms of juvenile arthritis are autoimmune disorders, which means that the body's immune system - which normally helps to fight off bacteria or viruses - mistakenly attacks some of its own healthy cells and tissues.
The result is inflammation, marked by redness, heat, pain, and swelling.
Inflammation can cause joint damage.
Doctors do not know why the immune system attacks healthy tissues in children who develop juvenile arthritis.
Scientists suspect that it is a two-step process.
First, something in a child's genetic makeup gives him or her a tendency to develop juvenile arthritis; then an environmental factor, such as a virus, triggers the development of the disease.
How Can Thalassemias Be Prevented?

McCune-Albright syndrome is characterized by fibrous dysplasia and other symptoms such as patches of pigmented skin light brown or 'cafe-au-lait' spots and endocrine problems such as early puberty precocious puberty, hyperthyroidism excess thyroid hormone, excess growth hormone gigantism or acromegaly, excess cortisol Cushing's syndrome, and other rare conditions.
What are the Symptoms of Shingles?
The first sign of shingles is often burning or tingling pain, or itch, in one particular location on only one side of the body.
After several days or a week, a rash of fluid-filled blisters appears.
These are similar to chickenpox but appear in a cluster rather than scattered over the body.
The cluster typically appears in one area on one side of the body.
Recent studies have shown that subtle cases of shingles with only a few blisters, or none, are more common than previously thought.
These cases may remain unrecognized.
Cases without any known lesions are known as zoster sineherpete.
Who Needs Cardiac Catheterization?
Cardiac catheterization also might be used if your doctor thinks you have a heart defect or if you're about to have heart surgery.
The procedure shows the overall shape of your heart and the four large spaces heart chambers inside it.

What other examples of outbreaks with influenza viruses that normally circulate in swine are there?
Probably the most well-known is an outbreak of 'swine flu' among soldiers in Fort Dix, New Jersey in 1976.
The virus caused disease with x-ray evidence of pneumonia in at least four soldiers with one death; all of these patients had previously been healthy.
The virus was transmitted to close contacts in a basic training environment, with limited transmission outside the basic training group.
The virus is thought to have circulated for a month and then disappeared.
The source of the virus, the exact time of its introduction into Fort Dix, and factors limiting its spread and duration are unknown.
The Fort Dix outbreak may have been caused by introduction of an animal virus into a stressed human population in close contact in crowded facilities during the winter.
The variant influenza A virus collected from a Fort Dix soldier was named A/New Jersey/76 Hsw1N1.
In July 2012, outbreaks of an H3N2v virus were detected in the United States.
For more information, visit the CDC H3N2v landing page.
What causes diverticular disease?
Doctors are not sure what causes diverticular disease.
Many think a diet low in fiber is the main cause.
Fiber is a part of food that your body cannot digest.
It is found in many fruits and vegetables.
Fiber stays in the colon and absorbs water, which makes bowel movements easier to pass.
Diets low in fiber may cause constipation, which occurs when stools are hard and difficult to pass.
Constipation causes your muscles to strain when you pass stool.
Straining may cause diverticula to form in the colon.
If stool or bacteria get caught in the pouches, diverticulitis can occur.
What are Infantile Spasms?
An infantile spasm IS is a specific type of seizure seen in an epilepsy syndrome of infancy and childhood known as West Syndrome.
West Syndrome is characterized by infantile spasms, developmental regression, and a specific pattern on electroencephalography EEG testing called hypsarrhythmia chaotic brain waves.
The onset of infantile spasms is usually in the first year of life, typically between 4-8 months.
The seizures primarily consist of a sudden bending forward of the body with stiffening of the arms and legs; some children arch their backs as they extend their arms and legs.
Spasms tend to occur upon awakening or after feeding, and often occur in clusters of up to 100 spasms at a time.
Infants may have dozens of clusters and several hundred spasms per day.
Infantile spasms usually stop by age five, but may be replaced by other seizure types.
Many underlying disorders, such as birth injury, metabolic disorders, and genetic disorders can give rise to spasms, making it important to identify the underlying cause.
In some children, no cause can be found.

What are some common signs of autism?
Many children with an ASD engage in repetitive movements such as rocking and twirling, or in self-abusive behavior such as biting or head-banging.
They also tend to start speaking later than other children and may refer to themselves by name instead of 'I' or 'me.' Children with an ASD don't know how to play interactively with other children.
Some speak in a sing-song voice about a narrow range of favorite topics, with little regard for the interests of the person to whom they are speaking.
How can I avoid getting the flu or giving the flu to others?
The flu is spread from person-to-person by coughing or sneezing by people with influenza.

Is there any treatment for Dementia?
Drugs to specifically treat Alzheimer's disease and some other progressive dementias are now available.
Although these drugs do not halt the disease or reverse existing brain damage, they can improve symptoms and slow the progression of the disease.
This may improve an individual's quality of life, ease the burden on caregivers, or delay admission to a nursing home.
Many researchers are also examining whether these drugs may be useful for treating other types of dementia.
Many people with dementia, particularly those in the early stages, may benefit from practicing tasks designed to improve performance in specific aspects of cognitive functioning.
For example, people can sometimes be taught to use memory aids, such as mnemonics, computerized recall devices, or note taking.

What research is being done for Meningitis?
The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS, a component of the National Institutes of Health NIH within the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, conducts and supports a wide range of research on neurological disorders, including meningitis and encephalitis.
Current research efforts include gaining a better understanding of how the central nervous system responds to inflammation and the role of T cells blood cells involved in immune system response in suppressing infection in the brain.
Scientists hope to better understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the protection and disruption of the blood-brain barrier, which could lead to the development of new treatments for several neuroinflammatory diseases such as meningitis and encephalitis.
Other scientists hope to define, at a molecular level, how certain viruses overcome the body's defense mechanism and interact with target host cells.
A possible therapeutic approach under investigation involves testing neuroprotective compounds that block the damage that accumulates after the infection and inflammation of meningitis and encephalitis and can lead to potential complications including loss of cognitive function and dementia.

What are Paraneoplastic Syndromes?
Paraneoplastic syndromes are a group of rare disorders that are triggered by an abnormal immune system response to a cancerous tumor known as a neoplasm.
Paraneoplastic syndromes are thought to happen when cancer-fighting antibodies or white blood cells known as T cells mistakenly attack normal cells in the nervous system.
These disorders typically affect middle-aged to older people and are most common in individuals with lung, ovarian, lymphatic, or breast cancer.
Neurologic symptoms generally develop over a period of days to weeks and usually occur prior to the tumor being discovered.
These symptoms may include difficulty in walking or swallowing, loss of muscle tone, loss of fine motor coordination, slurred speech, memory loss, vision problems, sleep disturbances, dementia, seizures, sensory loss in the limbs, and vertigo or dizziness.
Paraneoplastic syndromes include Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, stiff-person syndrome, encephalomyelitis, myasthenia gravis, cerebellar degeneration, limbic or brainstem encephalitis, neuromyotonia, opsoclonus, and sensory neuropathy.

What is Anaplasmosis caused by?
Anaplasmosis is caused by the bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum.
How Does Epilepsy Affect Daily Life?
Most people with epilepsy lead outwardly normal lives.
Approximately 80 percent can be significantly helped by modern therapies, and some may go months or years between seizures.
However, the condition can and does affect daily life for people with epilepsy, their family, and their friends.
People with severe seizures that resist treatment have, on average, a shorter life expectancy and an increased risk of cognitive impairment, particularly if the seizures developed in early childhood.
These impairments may be related to the underlying conditions that cause epilepsy or to epilepsy treatment rather than the epilepsy itself.
Is there any treatment for Dandy-Walker Syndrome?
Treatment for individuals with Dandy-Walker Syndrome generally consists of treating the associated problems, if needed.
A surgical procedure called a shunt may be required to drain off excess fluid within the brain.
This will reduce intracranial pressure and help control swelling.
Parents of children with Dandy-Walker Syndrome may benefit from genetic counseling if they intend to have more children.
What happened in 1976 with GBS and the swine flu vaccine?
In 1976 there was a small increased risk of GBS following vaccination with an influenza vaccine made to protect against a swine flu virus.
The increased risk was approximately 1 additional case of GBS per 100,000 people who got the swine flu vaccine.
The Institute of Medicine IOM conducted a thorough scientific review of this issue in 2003 and concluded that people who received the 1976 swine influenza vaccine had an increased risk for developing GBS.
Scientists have multiple theories on why this increased risk may have occurred, but the exact reason for this association remains unknown.
What is the biliary tract?
The liver produces bile - a fl uid that carries toxins and waste products out of the body and helps the body digest fats and the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K.
Bile mostly consists of cholesterol, bile salts, and bilirubin.
Bilirubin, a reddish-yellow substance, forms when hemoglobin from red blood cells breaks down.
Most bilirubin is excreted through bile.
How is spina bifida treated?

Fetal surgery is performed in utero within the uterus and involves opening the mother's abdomen and uterus and sewing shut the abnormal opening over the developing baby's spinal cord.
Some doctors believe the earlier the defect is corrected, the better the baby's outcome.
Although the procedure cannot restore lost neurological function, it may prevent additional loss from occurring.
What is Fabry Disease?
Fabry disease is caused by the lack of or faulty enzyme needed to metabolize lipids, fat-like substances that include oils, waxes, and fatty acids.
The disease is also called alpha-galactosidase-A deficiency.
A mutation in the gene that controls this enzyme causes insufficient breakdown of lipids, which build up to harmful levels in the eyes, kidneys, autonomic nervous system, and cardiovascular system.
Fabry disease is one of several lipid storage disorders and the only X-linked lipid storage disease.
Since the gene that is altered is carried on a mother's X chromosome, her sons have a 50 percent chance of inheriting the disorder and her daughters have a 50 percent chance of being a carrier.
A milder form is common in females, and occasionally some affected females may have severe manifestations similar to males with the disorder.
Symptoms usually begin during childhood or adolescence and include burning sensations in the hands that gets worse with exercise and hot weather and small, non-cancerous, raised reddish-purple blemishes on the skin.
Some boys will also have eye manifestations, especially cloudiness of the cornea.
Lipid storage may lead to impaired arterial circulation and increased risk of heart attack or stroke.
The heart may also become enlarged and the kidneys may become progressively involved.
Other signs include decreased sweating, fever, and gastrointestinal difficulties.
What is Sotos Syndrome?
Sotos syndrome cerebral gigantism is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutation in the NSD1 gene on chromosome 5.
It is characterized by excessive physical growth during the first few years of life.
Children with Sotos syndrome tend to be large at birth and are often taller, heavier, and have larger heads macrocrania than is normal for their age.
Symptoms of the disorder, which vary among individuals, include a disproportionately large and long head with a slightly protrusive forehead and pointed chin, large hands and feet, hypertelorism an abnormally increased distance between the eyes, and down-slanting eyes.
The disorder is often accompanied by mild mental retardation; delayed motor, cognitive, and social development; hypotonia low muscle tone, and speech impairments.
Clumsiness, an awkward gait, and unusual aggressiveness or irritability may also occur.
Although most cases of Sotos syndrome occur sporadically meaning they are not known to be inherited, familial cases have also been reported.
Why is alcohol dangerous?
Alcohol in the mother's blood passes to the baby through the umbilical cord.
Drinking alcohol during pregnancy can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, and a range of lifelong physical, behavioral, and intellectual disabilities.
These disabilities are known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders FASDs.
Children with FASDs might have the following characteristics and behaviors:
Is there any treatment for Neurological Sequelae Of Lupus?
There is no cure for lupus.
Treatment is symptomatic.
With a combination of medication, rest, exercise, proper nutrition, and stress management, most individuals with lupus can often achieve remission or reduce their symptom levels.
Medications used in the treatment of lupus may include aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, antimalarials, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressive drugs.
What causes chronic diarrhea in children?
Infections, food allergies and intolerances, and IBD may cause chronic diarrhea along with malabsorption, meaning the small intestine does not absorb nutrients from food.
If children do not absorb enough nutrients from the food they eat, they may become malnourished.
Functional GI disorders do not cause malabsorption.
What are Riding bikes?
Riding bikes is a great way for you to get active.
I've heard that many organic and raw milk producers are creating sanitary and humane conditions for raising animals and producing safe raw milk and raw milk products like cheeses and yogurts.
Does this help reduce milk contamination?
Adherence to good hygienic practices during milking can reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of milk contamination.
The dairy farm environment is a reservoir for illness-causing germs.
No matter what precautions farmers take, and even if their raw milk tests come back negative, they cannot guarantee that their milk, or the products made from their milk, are free of harmful germs.
What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Coronary Heart Disease?
Angina may feel like pressure or squeezing in your chest.
You also may feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back.
Angina pain may even feel like indigestion.
The pain tends to get worse with activity and go away with rest.
Emotional stress also can trigger the pain.
What is Inflammation?
Inflammation is the body's response to injury or infection.
If the Doctor Recommends Surgery, Which Procedure Is Best?
Many surgical techniques can be used to correct the curves of scoliosis.
The main surgical procedure is correction, stabilization, and fusion of the curve.
Fusion is the joining of two or more vertebrae.
There are different ways to straighten the spine and different implants to keep the spine stable after surgery.
Implants are devices that remain in the patient after surgery to keep the spine aligned.
The decision about the type of implant will depend on the cost, the size of the implant, which depends on the size of the patient; the shape of the implant; its safety; and the experience of the surgeon.
Each patient should discuss his or her options with at least two experienced surgeons.
What research is being done for Orthostatic Hypotension?
The NINDS supports research on conditions such as neurogenic orthostatic hypotension aimed at increasing scientific understanding of the condition and finding ways to treat and prevent it.
How is a peptic ulcer treated?
Peptic ulcers are treated based on their cause.
In the case of NSAID-induced ulcers, the presence of H.
pylori also determines the treatment strategy.
What is the intradermal flu vaccine?
'Fluzone Intradermal' was first made available in the 2011-2012 flu season.
The intradermal flu vaccine is a shot that is injected into the skin instead of the muscle.
The intradermal shot uses a much smaller needle than the regular flu shot, and it requires less antigen to be as effective as the regular flu shot.
Antigen is the part of the vaccine that helps your body build up protection against flu viruses.
Where is Most of the sodium we consume?
Most of the sodium we consume is in the form of salt, and the vast majority of sodium we consume is in processed and restaurant foods.
Are there treatments available?
There is no cure for Asperger syndrome and the autism spectrum disorders.
The ideal treatment plan coordinates therapies and interventions that meet the specific needs of individual children.
There is no single best treatment package for all children with AS, but most health care professionals agree that early intervention is best.
How is bleeding in the digestive tract treated?
An interventional radiologist can use an angiogram to inject medications or other materials into blood vessels to stop some types of bleeding.
When infections or ulcers cause the bleeding, health care providers prescribe medications to treat the problem.
When a person has severe acute bleeding or bleeding that does not stop, a surgeon may need to perform a laparoscopy or laparotomy to stop the bleeding.
How is cerebral palsy treated?
Physical therapy, usually begun in the first few years of life or soon after the diagnosis is made, is a cornerstone of CP treatment.
Specific sets of exercises such as resistive, or strength training programs and activities can maintain or improve muscle strength, balance, and motor skills, and prevent contractures.
Special braces called orthotic devices may be used to improve mobility and stretch spastic muscles.

What Is Bronchoscopy?
During the procedure, your doctor inserts a thin, flexible tube called a bronchoscope into your nose or mouth.
The tube is passed down your throat into your airways.
If you have a breathing tube, the bronchoscope can be passed through the tube to your airways.
You'll be given medicine to make you relaxed and sleepy during the procedure.
What should you expect after Treatment?
People have different responses to treatment.
Some people who have frequent therapeutic phlebotomy may feel very tired.
People who have advanced disease or who are getting intense treatment that weakens them may need help with daily tasks and activities.
Is there any treatment for Coffin Lowry Syndrome?
There is no cure and no standard course of treatment for Coffin-Lowry syndrome.
Treatment is symptomatic and supportive, and may include physical and speech therapy and educational services.
What is the prognosis for Multi-Infarct Dementia?
The prognosis for individuals with MID is generally poor.
The symptoms of the disorder may begin suddenly, often in a step-wise pattern after each small stroke.
Some people with MID may even appear to improve for short periods of time, then decline after having more silent strokes.
The disorder generally takes a downward course with intermittent periods of rapid deterioration.
Death may occur from stroke, heart disease, pneumonia, or other infection.
What is Colonoscopy?
Colonoscopy is a procedure that uses a long, flexible, narrow tube with a light and tiny camera on one end, called a colonoscope or scope, to look inside the rectum and entire colon.
Can antacids or milk help peptic ulcers heal?
Some of the antibiotics used for H.
pylori infection may not work as well if you take antacids.
And while antacids may make ulcer pain go away for a while, they won't kill the H.
pylori germ.
Only antibiotics can do that.
Who Gets Parkinson's Disease?
One clear risk factor for PD is age.
The average age of onset is 60 years, and the incidence rises significantly with increasing age.
However, about 5 to 10 percent of people with PD have early-onset disease that begins before the age of 50.
Some early onset cases are linked to specific gene mutations such as parkin.
People with one or more close relatives who have PD have an increased risk of developing the disease themselves, but the total risk is still about 2 to 5 percent unless the family has a known gene mutation for the disease.
An estimated 15 to 25 percent of people with PD have a known relative with the disease.
What is the prognosis for Peripheral Neuropathy?
In acute neuropathies, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, symptoms appear suddenly, progress rapidly, and resolve slowly as damaged nerves heal.
In chronic forms, symptoms begin subtly and progress slowly.
Some people may have periods of relief followed by relapse.
Others may reach a plateau stage where symptoms stay the same for many months or years.
Some chronic neuropathies worsen over time, but very few forms prove fatal unless complicated by other diseases.
Occasionally the neuropathy is a symptom of another disorder.
What causes TS?
Although the cause of TS is unknown, current research points to abnormalities in certain brain regions including the basal ganglia, frontal lobes, and cortex, the circuits that interconnect these regions, and the neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine responsible for communication among nerve cells.
Given the often complex presentation of TS, the cause of the disorder is likely to be equally complex.
How Can Bronchiectasis Be Prevented?

What is A chest x ray?
A chest x ray is a painless test that creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart and lungs.
What is the role of the thymus gland in myasthenia gravis?
The thymus gland, which lies in the chest area beneath the breastbone, plays an important role in the development of the immune system in early life.
Its cells form a part of the body's normal immune system.
The gland is somewhat large in infants, grows gradually until puberty, and then gets smaller and is replaced by fat with age.
In adults with myasthenia gravis, the thymus gland remains large and is abnormal.
It contains certain clusters of immune cells indicative of lymphoid hyperplasia - a condition usually found only in the spleen and lymph nodes during an active immune response.
Some individuals with myasthenia gravis develop thymomas tumors of the thymus gland.
Thymomas are generally benign, but they can become malignant.

The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus.
What should you expect during a Heart Transplant?
Just before heart transplant surgery, the patient will get general anesthesia AN-es-THE-ze-ah.
The term anesthesia refers to a loss of feeling and awareness.
General anesthesia temporarily puts you to sleep.
Why is MMR vaccine given after the first birthday?
Most infants born in the United States will receive passive protection against measles, mumps, and rubella in the form of antibodies from their mothers.
These antibodies can destroy the vaccine virus if they are present when the vaccine is given and, thus, can cause the vaccine to be ineffective.
By 12 months of age, almost all infants have lost this passive protection.
What is Infection?
Infection is a major cause of hospital admission for heart transplant patients.
What research is being done for Fahr's Syndrome?
The NINDS supports and conducts research on neurogenetic disorders such as Fahr's Syndrome.

What Are the Risks of Using a Holter or Event Monitor?
The sticky patches used to attach the sensors electrodes to your chest have a small risk of skin irritation.
You also may have an allergic reaction to the paste or gel that's sometimes used to attach the patches.
The irritation will go away once the patches are removed.
Why is monitoring mental illness important?
CDC surveillance systems provide several types of mental health information, such as estimates of the prevalence of diagnosed mental illness from self-report or recorded diagnosis, estimates of the prevalence of symptoms associated with mental illness, and estimates of the effect of mental illness on health and well-being.
What is Constipation caused by?
Constipation is caused by stool spending too much time in the colon.
Does the vaccine contain mercury or thimerosal?
No.
The vaccines do not contain thimerosal or any other preservative.
What Are the Symptoms of a Heritable Disorder of Connective Tissue?
The symptoms are different for different disorders.
Some of them cause bone growth problems.
People with bone growth disorders may have brittle bones or bones that are too long or too short.
Some cause people to be unusually tall Marfan syndrome or short chondrodysplasias, osteogenesis imperfecta, or to have head and facial structure malformations Apert syndrome, Pfeiffer syndrome.
In others, joints may be stiff or immobile fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva or FOP.
How are the muscular dystrophies treated?
Drug therapy may be prescribed to delay muscle degeneration.
Corticosteroids such as prednisone can slow the rate of muscle deterioration in Duchenne MD and help children retain strength and prolong independent walking by as much as several years.
However, these medicines have side effects such as weight gain, facial changes, loss of linear height growth, and bone fragility that can be especially troubling in children.
Immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporine and azathioprine can delay some damage to dying muscle cells.
Drugs that may provide short-term relief from myotonia muscle spasms and weakness include mexiletine; phenytoin; baclofen, which blocks signals sent from the spinal cord to contract the muscles; dantrolene, which interferes with the process of muscle contraction; and quinine.
Drugs for myotonia may not be effective in myotonic MD but work well for myotonia congenita, a genetic neuromuscular disorder characterized by the slow relaxation of the muscles.
Respiratory infections may be treated with antibiotics.
What are Generalized Gangliosidoses?
The GM1 gangliosidoses are caused by a deficiency of the enzyme beta-galactosidase.
Signs of early infantile GM1 gangliodisosis the most severe subtype, with onset shortly after birth may include neurodegeneration, seizures, liver and spleen enlargement, coarsening of facial features, skeletal irregularities, joint stiffness, distended abdomen, muscle weakness, exaggerated startle response, and problems with gait.
About half of affected persons develop cherry-red spots in the eye.
Children may be deaf and blind by age 1.
Onset of late infantile GM1 gangliosidosisis typically between ages 1 and 3 years.
Signs include ataxia, seizures, dementia, and difficulties with speech.
Adult GM1 gangliosidosis strikes between ages 3 and 30, with symptoms that include muscle atrophy, corneal clouding in some patients, and dystonia.
Non-cancerous skin blemishes may develop on the lower part of the trunk of the body.
Adult GM1 is usually less severe and progresses more slowly than other forms of the disorder.
What Is Osteoporosis?
Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone disease characterized by low bone mass, which makes bones fragile and susceptible to fracture.
Osteoporosis is known as a silent disease because symptoms and pain do not appear until a fracture occurs.
Without prevention or treatment, osteoporosis can progress painlessly until a bone breaks, typically in the hip, spine, or wrist.
A hip fracture can limit mobility and lead to a loss of independence, and vertebral fractures can result in a loss of height, stooped posture, and chronic pain.
What Are Holter and Event Monitors?
Holter and event monitors also are used to detect silent myocardial ischemia is-KE-me-ah.
In this condition, not enough oxygen-rich blood reaches the heart muscle.
Silent means that no symptoms occur.
How is CRPS diagnosed?
Testing also may be used to help rule out other conditions, such as arthritis syndromes, Lyme disease, generalized muscle diseases, a clotted vein, or small nerve fiber polyneuropathies such as from diabetes, because these require different treatment.
The distinguishing feature of CRPS is usually a history of earlier injury to the affected area, as most of these other conditions are not triggered by injury.
Individuals without a history of injury should be carefully examined to make sure that another treatable diagnosis is not missed.
What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Insomnia?
Insomnia also can affect your daily activities and cause serious problems.
For example, you may feel drowsy while driving.
Driver sleepiness not related to alcohol is responsible for almost 20 percent of all serious car crash injuries.
Research also shows that insomnia raises older women's risk of falling.
What Are Palpitations?
Palpitations pal-pi-TA-shuns are feelings that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, or beating too hard or too fast.

The upper GI tract includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum - the first part of the small intestine.
What is Leukodystrophy?
Leukodystrophy refers to progressive degeneration of the white matter of the brain due to imperfect growth or development of the myelin sheath, the fatty covering that acts as an insulator around nerve fiber.
Myelin, which lends its color to the white matter of the brain, is a complex substance made up of at least ten different chemicals.
The leukodystrophies are a group of disorders that are caused by genetic defects in how myelin produces or metabolizes these chemicals.
Each of the leukodystrophies is the result of a defect in the gene that controls one and only one of the chemicals.
Specific leukodystrophies include metachromatic leukodystrophy, Krabbe disease, adrenoleukodystrophy, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, Canavan disease, Childhood Ataxia with Central Nervous System Hypomyelination or CACH also known as Vanishing White Matter Disease, Alexander disease, Refsum disease, and cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
The most common symptom of a leukodystrophy disease is a gradual decline in an infant or child who previously appeared well.
Progressive loss may appear in body tone, movements, gait, speech, ability to eat, vision, hearing, and behavior.
There is often a slowdown in mental and physical development.
Symptoms vary according to the specific type of leukodystrophy, and may be difficult to recognize in the early stages of the disease.
Are you worried about a loved one's risk of falling?
Use these tips to start a conversation about preventing falls.
Is there any treatment for Multiple System Atrophy with Orthostatic Hypotension?
There is no cure for multiple system atrophy with orthostatic hypotension.
Treatment is aimed at controlling symptoms.
Anti-Parkinson medication such as Sinemet may improve the general sense of well-being.
Medications to elevate blood pressure while standing are often used, but may cause high blood pressure when lying down.
Individuals should sleep with the head of the bed elevated.
An artificial feeding tube or breathing tube may be required for problems with swallowing and breathing.
What is Depression?
Depression is a common feature of MS.
How is it Treated?
Recent studies have shown that steroids such as the steroid prednisone -- used to reduce inflammation and swelling --are effective in treating Bell's palsy.
Other drugs such as acyclovir -- used to fight viral herpes infections -- may also have some benefit in shortening the course of the disease.
Analgesics such as aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen may relieve pain.
Because of possible drug interactions, individuals taking prescription medicines should always talk to their doctors before taking any over-the-counter drugs.
What are Check Up On Your Bones?
Check Up On Your Bones is an interactive bone health checkup for people of all ages.
What is Targeted therapy?
Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells.
What is Glossopharyngeal Neuralgia?
Glossopharyngeal neuralgia GN is a rare pain syndrome that affects the glossopharyngeal nerve the ninth cranial nerve that lies deep within the neck and causes sharp, stabbing pulses of pain in the back of the throat and tongue, the tonsils, and the middle ear.
The excruciating pain of GN can last for a few seconds to a few minutes, and may return multiple times in a day or once every few weeks.
Many individuals with GN relate the attacks of pain to specific trigger factors such as swallowing, drinking cold liquids, sneezing, coughing, talking, clearing the throat, and touching the gums or inside the mouth.
GN can be caused by compression of the glossopharyngeal nerve, but in some cases, no cause is evident.
Like trigeminal neuralgia, it is associated with multiple sclerosis.
GN primarily affects the elderly.
What research is being done for Syncope?
The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health NIH conduct research related to syncope in laboratories at the NIH and support additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country.
Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent and treat syncope.
How is PSP different from Parkinson's disease?
Both PSP and Parkinson's disease cause stiffness, movement difficulties, and clumsiness.
However, people with PSP usually stand straight or occasionally even tilt their heads backward and tend to fall backward, while those with Parkinson's disease usually bend forward.
Problems with speech and swallowing are much more common and severe in PSP than in Parkinson's disease, and tend to show up earlier in the course of the disease.
Eye movements are abnormal in PSP but close to normal in Parkinson's disease.
Both diseases share other features: onset in late middle age, bradykinesia slow movement, and rigidity of muscles.
Tremor, very common in individuals with Parkinson's disease, is rare in PSP.
Although individuals with Parkinson's disease markedly benefit from the drug levodopa, people with PSP respond poorly and only transiently to this drug.
What are the signs of constipation in children?
stool in the child's underwear.
Delaying a bowel movement can result in a large mass of stool in the rectum, called a fecal impaction.
Stool builds up behind the impaction and may unexpectedly leak, soiling a child's underwear.
Parents often mistake this soiling as a sign of diarrhea.
What are Dystonias?
The dystonias are movement disorders in which sustained muscle contractions cause twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures.
The movements, which are involuntary and sometimes painful, may affect a single muscle; a group of muscles such as those in the arms, legs, or neck; or the entire body.
Early symptoms may include deterioration in handwriting, foot cramps, or a dragging foot after running or walking some distance.
Other possible symptoms are tremor and voice or speech difficulties.
About half the cases of dystonia have no connection to disease or injury and are called primary or idiopathic dystonia.
Of the primary dystonias, many cases appear to be inherited.
Dystonias can also be symptoms of other diseases, some of which may be hereditary.
In some individuals, symptoms of a dystonia appear in childhood.
For other individuals, the symptoms emerge in late adolescence or early adulthood.
What Are the Risks of a Ventricular Assist Device?

How many swine flu viruses are there?
Like influenza viruses in humans and other animals, swine flu viruses change constantly.
Pigs can be infected by avian influenza and human influenza viruses as well as swine influenza viruses.
When influenza viruses from different species infect pigs, the viruses can reassort i.e.
swap genes and new viruses that are a mix of swine, human and/or avian influenza viruses can emerge.
Over the years, different variations of swine flu viruses have emerged.
At this time, there are three main influenza type A virus subtypes that have been isolated in pigs in the United States: H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2.
What is Chickenpox?

What is liver transplantation?
Liver transplantation is surgery to remove a diseased or injured liver and replace it with a healthy one from another person, called a donor.
Many people have had liver transplants and now lead normal lives.
What is the prognosis for Febrile Seizures?
The vast majority of febrile seizures are short and harmless.
There is no evidence that short febrile seizures cause brain damage.
Certain children who have febrile seizures face an increased risk of developing epilepsy.
These children include those who have cerebral palsy, delayed development, or other neurological abnormalities, or who have febrile seizures that are lengthy or affect only one part of the body.
What Are the Signs and Symptoms of an Arrhythmia?
Many arrhythmias cause no signs or symptoms.

How Is Back Pain Diagnosed?
During the medical history, your doctor will ask questions about the nature of your pain and about any health problems you and close family members have or have had.
Questions might include the following:
What research is being done for Leukodystrophy?
The NINDS supports research on genetic disorders, including the leukodystrophies.
The goals of this research are to increase scientific understanding of these disorders, and to find ways to prevent, treat, and, ultimately, cure them.
What is Foraminotomy?
Foraminotomy is an operation that 'cleans out' or enlarges the bony hole foramen where a nerve root exits the spinal canal.
What Is Angina?
CHD is the most common type of heart disease in adults.
It occurs if a waxy substance called plaque plak builds up on the inner walls of your coronary arteries.
These arteries carry oxygen-rich blood to your heart.
What causes diarrhea?
Acute diarrhea is usually caused by a bacterial, viral, or parasitic infection.
Chronic diarrhea is usually related to a functional disorder such as irritable bowel syndrome or an intestinal disease such as Crohn's disease.
What is Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis?
Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis ADEM is characterized by a brief but widespread attack of inflammation in the brain and spinal cord that damages myelin - the protective covering of nerve fibers.
ADEM often follows viral or bacterial infections, or less often, vaccination for measles, mumps, or rubella.
The symptoms of ADEM appear rapidly, beginning with encephalitis-like symptoms such as fever, fatigue, headache, nausea and vomiting, and in the most severe cases, seizures and coma.
ADEM typically damages white matter brain tissue that takes its name from the white color of myelin, leading to neurological symptoms such as visual loss due to inflammation of the optic nerve in one or both eyes, weakness even to the point of paralysis, and difficulty coordinating voluntary muscle movements such as those used in walking.
ADEM is sometimes misdiagnosed as a severe first attack of multiple sclerosis MS, since the symptoms and the appearance of the white matter injury on brain imaging may be similar.
However, ADEM has several features which differentiate it from MS.
First, unlike MS patients, persons with ADEM will have rapid onset of fever, a history of recent infection or immunization, and some degree of impairment of consciousness, perhaps even coma; these features are not typically seen in MS.
Children are more likely than adults to have ADEM, whereas MS is a rare diagnosis in children.
In addition, ADEM usually consists of a single episode or attack of widespread myelin damage, while MS features many attacks over the course of time.
Doctors will often use imaging techniques, such as MRI magnetic resonance imaging, to search for old and new lesions areas of damage on the brain.
The presence of older brain lesions on MRI suggest that the condition may be MS rather than ADEM, since MS can cause brain lesions before symptoms become obvious.
In rare situations, a brain biopsy may be necessary to differentiate between ADEM and some other diseases that involve inflammation and damage to myelin.
What is the prognosis for Sturge-Weber Syndrome?
Although it is possible for the birthmark and atrophy in the cerebral cortex to be present without symptoms, most infants will develop convulsive seizures during their first year of life.
There is a greater likelihood of intellectual impairment when seizures start before the age of 2 and are resistant to treatment.
Prognosis is worst in the minority of children who have both sides of the brain affected by the blood vessel abnormalities.
What is Coma?
A coma, sometimes also called persistent vegetative state, is a profound or deep state of unconsciousness.
Persistent vegetative state is not brain-death.
An individual in a state of coma is alive but unable to move or respond to his or her environment.
Coma may occur as a complication of an underlying illness, or as a result of injuries, such as head trauma.
Individuals in such a state have lost their thinking abilities and awareness of their surroundings, but retain non-cognitive function and normal sleep patterns.
Even though those in a persistent vegetative state lose their higher brain functions, other key functions such as breathing and circulation remain relatively intact.
Spontaneous movements may occur, and the eyes may open in response to external stimuli.
Individuals may even occasionally grimace, cry, or laugh.
Although individuals in a persistent vegetative state may appear somewhat normal, they do not speak and they are unable to respond to commands.

What is Angelman Syndrome?
Angelman syndrome is a genetic disorder that causes developmental delay and neurological problems.
The physician Harry Angelman first delineated the syndrome in 1965, when he described several children in his practice as having flat heads, jerky movements, protruding tongues, and bouts of laughter.
Infants with Angelman syndrome appear normal at birth, but often have feeding problems in the first months of life and exhibit noticeable developmental delays by 6 to 12 months.
Seizures often begin between 2 and 3 years of age.
Speech impairment is pronounced, with little to no use of words.
Individuals with this syndrome often display hyperactivity, small head size, sleep disorders, and movement and balance disorders that can cause severe functional deficits.
Angelman syndrome results from absence of a functional copy of the UBE3A gene inherited from the mother.

What does an osteoporosis evaluation involve?
One thing your doctor will do is ask about your medical history and lifestyle to determine whether you have risk factors for osteoporosis.
Some of the factors that increase the risk of developing osteoporosis include personal or family history of fractures; low levels of the hormone estrogen or testosterone; and the use of certain medications, such as glucocorticoids or anti-seizure medications, that may contribute to bone fragility.
Your doctor also may want to test your blood or urine and may suggest that you have a bone mineral density test.
What Is Osteoporosis?
Osteoporosis is a silent disease until a fracture occurs.
Osteoporosis can often be prevented.
However, if undetected, it can worsen over many years without symptoms.
It has been called 'a pediatric disease with geriatric consequences,' because building healthy bones in one's youth is important to help prevent osteoporosis and broken bones later in life.

It affects men much more than women.
Symptoms also include muscle wasting, cramping, and involuntary contractions or twitching of the leg muscles.
The disorder is sometimes mistaken for amyotrophic laterial sclerosis ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease but unlike ALS, it is treatable.
An early and accurate diagnosis allows patients to recover quickly.
What causes IBS in children?
Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth SIBO.
Normally, few bacteria live in the small intestine.
SIBO is an increase in the number of bacteria or a change in the type of bacteria in the small intestine.
These bacteria can produce excess gas and may also cause diarrhea and weight loss.
Some researchers believe that SIBO may lead to IBS, and some studies have shown antibiotics to be effective in treating IBS.
However, the studies were weak and more research is needed to show a link between SIBO and IBS.

The substance makes your heart show up more clearly on the echo pictures.
What research is being done for Rett?
Scientists know that lack of a properly functioning MeCP2 protein disturbs the function of mature brain cells but they do not know the exact mechanisms by which this happens.
Investigators are trying to find other genetic switches that operate in a similar way to the MeCP2 protein.
Once they discover how the protein works and locate similar switches, they may devise therapies that can substitute for the malfunctioning switch.
Another outcome might involve manipulating other biochemical pathways to compensate for the malfunctioning MECP2 gene, thereby preventing progression of the disorder.
Gene therapy to achieve regulated expression of a normal MECP2 gene is also under study in animal models.

Imiquimod is an agonist for the toll-like receptor 7 and/or 8, inducing a helper T-cell cytokine cascade and interferon production.
What Are Its Symptoms and Signs?
The most common symptom of all types of juvenile arthritis is persistent joint swelling, pain, and stiffness that is typically worse in the morning or after a nap.
The pain may limit movement of the affected joint, although many children, especially younger ones, will not complain of pain.
Juvenile arthritis commonly affects the knees and the joints in the hands and feet.
One of the earliest signs of juvenile arthritis may be limping in the morning because of an affected knee.
Besides joint symptoms, children with systemic juvenile arthritis have a high fever and a skin rash.
The rash and fever may appear and disappear very quickly.
Systemic arthritis also may cause the lymph nodes located in the neck and other parts of the body to swell.
In some cases fewer than half, internal organs including the heart and very rarely the lungs, may be involved.
How Is High Blood Cholesterol Diagnosed?
Testing for total and HDL cholesterol does not require fasting.
If your total cholesterol is 200 mg/dL or more, or if your HDL cholesterol is less than 40 mg/dL, your doctor will likely recommend that you have a lipoprotein panel.

What research is being done for Deep Brain Stimulation for Parkinson's Disease?
Researchers are continuing to study DBS and to develop ways of improving it.
A two-part study funded by the NINDS and the Department of Veterans Affairs first compared bilateral DBS to best medical therapy, including medication adjustment and physical therapy.
Bilateral DBS showed overall superiority to best medical therapy at improving motor symptoms and quality of life.
The second part of the study, involving nearly 300 patients, compared subthalamic nucleus STN DBS to globus pallidus interna GPI DBS.
The two groups reported similar improvements in motor control and quality of life in scores on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale.
On a variety of neuropsychological tests, there were no significant differences between the two groups.
However, the STN DBS group experienced a greater decline on a test of visuomotor processing speed, which measures how quickly someone thinks and acts on information.
Also, the STN DBS group had slight worsening on a standard assessment of depression, while the GPI DBS group had slight improvement on the same test.
The importance of these two differences is not clear, and will be scrutinized in follow-up research.
What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Overweight and Obesity?
Weight gain usually happens over time.
Most people know when they've gained weight.
Some of the signs of overweight and obesity include:
How Are Growth Plate Fractures Diagnosed?
The doctor will begin the diagnostic process by asking about the injury and how it occurred and by examining the child.
The doctor will then use x rays to determine if there is a fracture, and if so, the type of fracture.
Often the doctor will x ray not only the injured limb but the opposite limb as well.
Because growth plates have not yet hardened into solid bone, neither the structures themselves nor injuries to them show up on x rays.
Instead, growth plates appear as gaps between the shaft of a long bone, called the metaphysis, and the end of the bone, called the epiphysis.
By comparing x rays of the injured limb to those of the noninjured limb, doctors can look for differences that indicate an injury.
What Is Diabetes?
Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, an organ located behind the stomach.
It is responsible for moving glucose from the bloodstream into the cells to provide energy needed for daily life.
In people with diabetes, the body produces too little or no insulin or it does not respond properly to the insulin that is produced.
As a result, glucose builds up in the blood and may overflow into the urine where it is excreted from the body.
Therefore, the cells lose their main source of energy.
What is Osteoarthritis?
Osteoarthritis is a common joint problem of the knees, hips, and lower back.
What is Tardive Dyskinesia?

Tardive dyskinesia is characterized by repetitive, involuntary, purposeless movements.
Features of the disorder may include grimacing, tongue protrusion, lip smacking, puckering and pursing, and rapid eye blinking.
Rapid movements of the arms, legs, and trunk may also occur.
Involuntary movements of the fingers may be present.
How Can the Family Help a Child Live Well With Juvenile Arthritis?
Learn as much as you can about your child's disease and its treatment.
The resources listed at the end of this publication can help.
Many treatment options are available, and because juvenile arthritis is different in each child, what works for one may not work for another.
If the medications that the doctor prescribes do not relieve symptoms or if they cause unpleasant side effects, you and your child should discuss other choices with the doctor.
A person with juvenile arthritis can be more active when symptoms are controlled.
Is colon cancer a concern with UC?
According to the U.S.
Preventive Services Task Force guidelines for colon cancer screening, people who have had IBD throughout the colon for at least 8 years and those who have had IBD in only the left side of the colon for 12 to 15 years should have a colonoscopy with biopsies every 1 to 2 years to check for dysplasia.
Such screening has not been proven to reduce the risk of colon cancer, but it may help identify cancer early and improve prognosis.
These guidelines were produced by an independent expert panel and endorsed by numerous organizations, including the American Cancer Society, the American College of Gastroenterology, the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons, and the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America.

What is the difference between acute and chronic back pain?
Acute back pain is pain that lasts from a few days to a few weeks.
It's often caused by an accident, a fall, or lifting something too heavy.
Acute back pain usually gets better without any treatment.
What is Cerebral Cavernous Malformation?
A cerebral cavernous malformation CCM is a collection of small blood vessels capillaries in the central nervous system CNS that is enlarged and irregular in structure.
In CCM, the walls of the capillaries are thinner than normal, less elastic, and prone to leaking.
Cavernous malformations can occur anywhere in the body, but usually only produce symptoms when they are found in the brain and spinal cord.
Some people with CCM - experts estimate 25 percent -- will never experience any related medical problems.
Others will have serious symptoms such as seizures most commonly, headaches, paralysis, hearing or vision changes, and bleeding in the brain cerebral hemorrhage.
There are familial inherited and sporadic occurring for no clear reason cases of CCM.
Researchers have discovered three different genes associated with CCM.
Studies are currently underway to understand the relationship between the mutations of each of these genes and their corresponding symptoms.

How Is Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Treated?
Doctors may prescribe medicines, oxygen therapy, pulmonary rehabilitation PR, and lung transplant to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis IPF.
What causes Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease?
The gene mutations in CMT disease are usually inherited.
Each of us normally possesses two copies of every gene, one inherited from each parent.
Some forms of CMT are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, which means that only one copy of the abnormal gene is needed to cause the disease.
Other forms of CMT are inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, which means that both copies of the abnormal gene must be present to cause the disease.
Still other forms of CMT are inherited in an X-linked fashion, which means that the abnormal gene is located on the X chromosome.
The X and Y chromosomes determine an individual's sex.
Individuals with two X chromosomes are female and individuals with one X and one Y chromosome are male.
What is Asthma?
Asthma is a lung disease that is caused by chronic inflammation of the airways.
What is a fistula?

Fistulas can develop during gestation or at any age after birth.
Fistulas that develop during gestation are more common in boys than girls.
How Is Peripheral Arterial Disease Diagnosed?
P.A.D.
often is diagnosed after symptoms are reported.
A correct diagnosis is important because people who have P.A.D.
are at higher risk for coronary heart disease CHD, heart attack, stroke, and transient ischemic attack mini-stroke.
If you have P.A.D., your doctor also may want to check for signs of these diseases and conditions.

What Is Osteoarthritis?
Osteoarthritis AH-stee-oh-ar-THREYE-tis is the most common type of arthritis and is seen especially among older people.
Sometimes it is called degenerative joint disease.
Osteoarthritis mostly affects cartilage KAR-til-uj, the hard but slippery tissue that covers the ends of bones where they meet to form a joint.
Healthy cartilage allows bones to glide over one another.
It also absorbs energy from the shock of physical movement.
In osteoarthritis, the surface layer of cartilage breaks and wears away.
This allows bones under the cartilage to rub together, causing pain, swelling, and loss of motion of the joint.
Over time, the joint may lose its normal shape.
Also, small deposits of bone - called osteophytes or bone spurs - may grow on the edges of the joint.
Bits of bone or cartilage can break off and float inside the joint space.
This causes more pain and damage.
What is Traumatic brain injury TBI?
Traumatic brain injury TBI is a major public health problem, especially among male adolescents and young adults ages 15 to 24, and among elderly people of both sexes 75 years and older.
What are the causes of myoclonus?
Myoclonus may develop in response to infection, head or spinal cord injury, stroke, brain tumors, kidney or liver failure, lipid storage disease, chemical or drug poisoning, or other disorders.
Prolonged oxygen deprivation to the brain, called hypoxia, may result in posthypoxic myoclonus.
Myoclonus can occur by itself, but most often it is one of several symptoms associated with a wide variety of nervous system disorders.
For example, myoclonic jerking may develop in patients with multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
Myoclonic jerks commonly occur in persons with epilepsy, a disorder in which the electrical activity in the brain becomes disordered leading to seizures.
How Is It Treated?
The main goals of treatment are to preserve a high level of physical and social functioning and maintain a good quality of life.
To achieve these goals, doctors recommend treatments to reduce swelling, maintain full movement in the affected joints, relieve pain, and prevent, identify, and treat complications.
Most children with juvenile arthritis need a combination of medication and nonmedication treatments to reach these goals.
How is diverticulosis treated?
Eating high-fiber foods can help relieve symptoms.
Sometimes mild pain medications also help.
What is Gastritis?
Gastritis is a condition in which the stomach lining - known as the mucosa - is inflamed.
What do researchers know about dystonia?
There are several genetic causes of dystonia.
Some forms appear to be inherited in a dominant manner, which means only one parent who carries the defective gene is needed to pass the disorder to their child.
Each child of a parent having the abnormal gene will have a 50 percent chance of carrying the defective gene.
It is important to note the symptoms may vary widely in type and severity even among members of the same family.
In some instances, persons who inherit the defective gene may not develop dystonia.
Having one mutated gene appears to be sufficient to cause the chemical imbalances that may lead to dystonia, but other genetic or even environmental factors may play a role.
Knowing the pattern of inheritance can help families understand the risk of passing dystonia along to future generations.
What is the prognosis for Parkinson's Disease?
PD is both chronic, meaning it persists over a long period of time, and progressive, meaning its symptoms grow worse over time.
Although some people become severely disabled, others experience only minor motor disruptions.
Tremor is the major symptom for some patients, while for others tremor is only a minor complaint and other symptoms are more troublesome.
No one can predict which symptoms will affect an individual patient, and the intensity of the symptoms also varies from person to person.

What can I do as a parent or guardian to help prevent childhood overweight and obesity?
Remember that the goal for overweight and obese children and teens is to reduce the rate of weight gain while allowing normal growth and development.
Children and teens should NOT be placed on a weight reduction diet without the consultation of a health care provider.
What is Shaken Baby Syndrome?
Shaken baby syndrome is a type of inflicted traumatic brain injury that happens when a baby is violently shaken.
A baby has weak neck muscles and a large, heavy head.
Shaking makes the fragile brain bounce back and forth inside the skull and causes bruising, swelling, and bleeding, which can lead to permanent, severe brain damage or death.
The characteristic injuries of shaken baby syndrome are subdural hemorrhages bleeding in the brain, retinal hemorrhages bleeding in the retina, damage to the spinal cord and neck, and fractures of the ribs and bones.
These injuries may not be immediately noticeable.
Symptoms of shaken baby syndrome include extreme irritability, lethargy, poor feeding, breathing problems, convulsions, vomiting, and pale or bluish skin.
Shaken baby injuries usually occur in children younger than 2 years old, but may be seen in children up to the age of 5.
What is the prognosis for Essential Tremor?
Although essential tremor is not life-threatening, it can make it harder to perform daily tasks and is embarrassing to some people.
Tremor frequency may decrease as the person ages, but the severity may increase, affecting the person's ability to perform certain tasks or activities of daily living.
In many people the tremor may be mild throughout life.
How is cirrhosis treated?
Treatment for cirrhosis depends on the cause of the disease and whether complications are present.
In the early stages of cirrhosis, the goals of treatment are to slow the progression of tissue scarring in the liver and prevent complications.
As cirrhosis progresses, a person may need additional treatments and hospitalization to manage complications.
Treatment may include the following:

What research is being done for Arteriovenous?
Finally, several ongoing studies are devoted to developing new noninvasive neuroimaging technologies to increase the effectiveness and safety of AVM surgery.
Some scientists are pioneering the use of MRI to measure amounts of oxygen present in the brain tissue of patients with vascular lesions in order to predict the brain's response to surgical therapies.
Others are developing a new micro-imager that may be inserted into catheters to increase the accuracy of angiography.
In addition, new types of noninvasive imaging devices are being developed that detect functional brain activity through changes in tissue light emission or reflectance.
This technology may prove more sensitive than MRI and other imaging devices currently available, giving surgeons a new tool for improving the efficacy and safety of AVM surgery.
What is Biologic therapy?
Biologic therapy is a cancer treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer.
Is there any treatment for Niemann-Pick Disease?
There is currently no cure for Niemann-Pick disease.
Children usually die from infection or progressive neurological loss.
There is currently no effective treatment for persons with type A.
Bone marrow transplantation has been attempted in a few patients with type B, and encouraging results have been reported.
The development of enzyme replacement and gene therapies might also be helpful for those with type B.
Individuals with types C and D are frequently placed on a low-cholesterol diet and/or cholesterol lowering drugs, but research has not shown these interventions to change the abnormal cholesterol metabolism or halt disease progression.
Is it worth the risk?
The phrase what happens on spring break stays on spring break can imply that it is okay - even expected - to engage in risky behaviors that you would not normally consider in your daily life, but you should take your healthy behaviors on vacation with you:
What has the discovery of bat influenza taught us about influenza viruses?
The discovery of bat influenza has shed light on the evolution of influenza A, B and C viruses.
It is possible that many of the internal genes of this new bat influenza virus are descendants of influenza virus families that once circulated more widely in previous centuries and that are now extinct - or yet to be discovered.
What is Myasthenia gravis?
Myasthenia gravis is the most common autoimmune disease associated with thymoma.
What Research Is Being Conducted on Juvenile Arthritis?
Researchers keep trying to improve existing treatments for children and find new medicines that will work better with fewer side effects.
That effort received a major boost with the passage of the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, which requires drugs that might be used in children to be tested in children.
As a result of the act, increasing numbers of medications are being tested for safety and effectiveness in children.
Consequently, doctors will have more information on appropriate medications and doses to prescribe for their pediatric patients.
What is Creatine kinase?
Creatine kinase is an enzyme that leaks out of damaged muscle.
Is there any treatment for Orthostatic Hypotension?
When orthostatic hypotension is caused by hypovolemia due to medications, the disorder may be reversed by adjusting the dosage or by discontinuing the medication.
When the condition is caused by prolonged bed rest, improvement may occur by sitting up with increasing frequency each day.
In some cases, physical counterpressure such as elastic hose or whole-body inflatable suits may be required.
Dehydration is treated with salt and fluids.
More severe cases can be treated with drugs, such as midodrine, to raise blood pressure.
What research is being done for Hypersomnia?
The NINDS supports and conducts research on sleep disorders such as hypersomnia.
The goal of this research is to increase scientific understanding of the condition, find improved methods of diagnosing and treating it, and discover ways to prevent it.
Can antacids or milk help a peptic ulcer heal?
People used to believe drinking milk helped peptic ulcers heal.
But doctors know now that while milk may make an ulcer feel better briefly, it also increases stomach acid, which can make ulcers worse.
Patients should talk with their doctor about drinking milk while an ulcer is healing.
What research is being done for Spinal?
Between 2003 and 2012, the NINDS piloted the Spinal Muscular Atrophy Project to expedite therapeutics development for this hereditary neurodegenerative disease.
The Project was designed to accelerate the research process by identifying drugs already in use that increase the level of SMN protein in cultured cells, so that they could be used as potential leads for further drug discovery and clinical testing.
Read more about the history of this pioneering effort and how it led to collaboration with several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.

Chagas disease can be spread to an organ transplant recipient if a donated organ came from a person with Chagas disease.
What is the prognosis for Cushing's Syndrome?
The prognosis for those with Cushing's syndrome varies depending on the cause of the disease.
Most cases of Cushing's syndrome can be cured.
Many individuals with Cushing's syndrome show significant improvement with treatment, although some may find recovery complicated by various aspects of the causative illness.
Some kinds of tumors may recur.
Does Scoliosis Have to Be Treated? What Are the Treatments?
Bracing.
Doctors may advise patients to wear a brace to stop a curve from getting any worse in patients who are still growing with moderate spinal curvature.
As a child nears the end of growth, the indications for bracing will depend on how the curve affects the child's appearance, whether the curve is getting worse, and the size of the curve.
What is Tabes Dorsalis?
Tabes dorsalis is a slow degeneration of the nerve cells and nerve fibers that carry sensory information to the brain.
The degenerating nerves are in the dorsal columns of the spinal cord the portion closest to the back of the body and carry information that help maintain a person's sense of position.
Tabes dorsalis is the result of an untreated syphilis infection.
Symptoms may not appear for some decades after the initial infection and include weakness, diminished reflexes, unsteady gait, progressive degeneration of the joints, loss of coordination, episodes of intense pain and disturbed sensation, personality changes, dementia, deafness, visual impairment, and impaired response to light.
The disease is more frequent in males than in females.
Onset is commonly during mid-life.
The incidence of tabes dorsalis is rising, in part due to co-associated HIV infection.
How do I know if my child is growing and developing on schedule?
Your child's doctor or nurse can help you identify 'developmental milestones,' or signs to look for in your child.
This is an important part of the well-child visit.
How Can Fanconi Anemia Be Prevented?
If you're at high risk for FA and are planning to have children, you may want to consider genetic counseling.
A counselor can help you understand your risk of having a child who has FA.
He or she also can explain the choices that are available to you.
What Research is Being Done?
A healthy immune system protects against all kinds of diseases, but people with weakened immunity are vulnerable to many illnesses, including shingles.
Antibodies, one of the immune system's major defense mechanisms against infection, are not very helpful against shingles.
The immune cells that appear to combat shingles are two types of white blood cells: T lymphocytes and macrophages.
Scientists are trying to find ways to boost the activity of these cells - especially in patients at high risk for severe or disseminated shingles a rare condition in which the virus spreads to other areas of the body, sometimes vital areas such as the blood or the lungs.
What is Batten disease?
Batten disease is a fatal, inherited disorder of the nervous system that typically begins in childhood.
What is Heart failure?
Heart failure is a condition in which the heart is damaged or weak.
What is the prognosis for Machado-Joseph Disease?
The severity of the disease is related to the age of onset, with earlier onset associated with more severe forms of the disease.
Symptoms can begin any time between early adolescence and about 70 years of age.
MJD is a progressive disease, meaning that symptoms get worse with time.
Life expectancy ranges from the mid-thirties for those with severe forms of MJD to a normal life expectancy for those with mild forms.
The cause of death for those who die early is often aspiration pneumonia.
What Are the Risks of Sleep Studies?
Although the risks of sleep studies are minimal, these studies take time at least several hours.
If you're having a daytime sleep study, bring a book or something to do during the test.
Phantom Pain: How Does the Brain Feel?
Our understanding of phantom pain has improved tremendously in recent years.
Investigators previously believed that brain cells affected by amputation simply died off.
They attributed sensations of pain at the site of the amputation to irritation of nerves located near the limb stump.
Now, using imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography PET and magnetic resonance imaging MRI, scientists can actually visualize increased activity in the brain's cortex when an individual feels phantom pain.
When study participants move the stump of an amputated limb, neurons in the brain remain dynamic and excitable.
Surprisingly, the brain's cells can be stimulated by other body parts, often those located closest to the missing limb.
What are the reasons for doing these experiments?
The influenza pandemic of 1918-19 killed an estimated 20 to 50 million people worldwide, many more than the subsequent pandemics of the 20th century.
The biological properties that confer virulence to pandemic influenza viruses were poorly understood.
Research to better understand how the individual genes of the1918 pandemic influenza virus contribute to the disease process could provide important insights into the basis of virulence.
This kind of information will enable us to devise appropriate strategies for early diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, should a similar pandemic virus emerge.
Additionally, such research will provide us with general principles with which we can better design antiviral drugs and other interventions against all influenza viruses with enhanced virulence.

What is the prognosis for Arachnoiditis?
Arachnoiditis is a disorder that causes chronic pain and neurological deficits and does not improve significantly with treatment.
Surgery may only provide temporary relief.
The outlook for someone with arachnoiditis is complicated by the fact that the disorder has no predictable pattern or severity of symptoms.
What Is Osteoarthritis?
Osteoarthritis is a condition that causes changes in cartilage, the elastic tissue that cushions the joints.
Healthy cartilage allows bones to glide over one another, while absorbing energy from the shock of physical movement.
In osteoarthritis, the surface layer of cartilage breaks down and wears away.
This allows bones under the cartilage to rub together, causing pain, swelling, and loss of motion of the joint.
What is Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease?
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease CJD is a rare, degenerative, invariably fatal brain disorder.
Typically, onset of symptoms occurs at about age 60.
There are three major categories of CJD: sporadic CJD, hereditary CJD, and acquired CJD.
There is currently no single diagnostic test for CJD.
The first concern is to rule out treatable forms of dementia such as encephalitis or chronic meningitis.
The only way to confirm a diagnosis of CJD is by brain biopsy or autopsy.
In a brain biopsy, a neurosurgeon removes a small piece of tissue from the patient's brain so that it can be examined by a neurologist.
Because a correct diagnosis of CJD does not help the patient, a brain biopsy is discouraged unless it is need to rule out a treatable disorder.
While CJD can be transmitted to other people, the risk of this happening is extremely small.
What is Chemotherapy?
Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
What research is being done for Multi-Infarct Dementia?
The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS conducts research related to MID in its laboratories at the National Institutes of Health NIH, and also supports additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country.
Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure the vascular dementias, such as MID.
How does vasculitis affect the nervous system?
Vasculitis can cause problems in any organ system, including the central CNS and peripheral PNS nervous systems.
Vasculitic disorders, or syndromes, of the CNS and PNS are characterized by the presence of inflammatory cells in and around blood vessels, and secondary narrowing or blockage of the blood vessels that nourish the brain, spinal cord, or peripheral nerves.
Any type or size of blood vessel may be involved - arteries, arterioles, veins, venules, or capillaries.
What are the benefits of breastfeeding?
Breastfeeding gives you and your baby time to be close, get to know each other, and bond.
Breastfeeding is a healthy choice for both moms and babies.
What is the appendix?
The appendix is a fingerlike pouch attached to the large intestine in the lower right area of the abdomen, the area between the chest and hips.
The large intestine is part of the body's gastrointestinal GI tract.
The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus.
The movement of muscles in the GI tract, along with the release of hormones and enzymes, helps digest food.
The appendix does not appear to have a specific function in the body, and removing it does not seem to affect a person's health.
What Is Juvenile Arthritis?
Juvenile arthritis occurs in children 16 years of age or younger.
Children with severe juvenile arthritis may be candidates for glucocorticoid medication, the use of which has been linked to bone loss in children as well as adults.
Physical activity can be challenging in children with juvenile arthritis because it may cause pain.
Incorporating physical activities recommended by the child's doctor and a diet rich in calcium and vitamin D is especially important, so that these children can build adequate bone mass and reduce the risk of future fracture.
Is there any treatment for Whiplash?
Treatment for individuals with whiplash may include pain medications, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antidepressants, muscle relaxants, and a cervical collar usually worn for 2 to 3 weeks.
Range of motion exercises, physical therapy, and cervical traction may also be prescribed.
Supplemental heat application may relieve muscle tension.
How Are Palpitations Treated?
Treatment for palpitations depends on their cause.
Most palpitations are harmless and often go away on their own.
In these cases, no treatment is needed.
What is Hormone therapy?
Hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing.
What Are the Risks of a Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant?
The main risks of a blood and marrow stem cell transplant are infections, graft-versus-host disease GVHD, and graft failure.
What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Asthma?
Not all people who have asthma have these symptoms.
Likewise, having these symptoms doesn't always mean that you have asthma.
The best way doctors have to diagnose asthma is to use a lung function test, ask about medical history including type and frequency of symptoms, and do a physical exam.
What should you expect during a Lung Transplant?
Once you're asleep, your doctors will make a small incision cut in your chest.
Next, they will insert a central venous catheter into a vein.
This tube allows easy access to your bloodstream.
Doctors use it to deliver fluids and medicines to your body.
What research is being done for Mitochondrial Myopathies?
The NINDS conducts and supports research on mitochondrial myopathies.
The goals of this research are to increase scientific understanding of these disorders and to find ways to effectively treat, prevent, or potentially cure them.
What Is Osteoporosis?
Osteoporosis is a condition in which the bones become less dense and more likely to fracture.
If not prevented or if left untreated, bone loss can progress painlessly until a bone breaks, typically in the hip, spine, or wrist.
A hip fracture can limit mobility and lead to a loss of independence, and vertebral fractures can result in a loss of height, stooped posture, and chronic pain.
What Proven Strategies Work to Reduce U.S.
Smoking Rates?
Smoking has been the number one cause of preventable death and disease in this country for decades.
The death and disease from tobacco - which claims more than 480,000 lives each year - is overwhelmingly caused by cigarettes and other burned tobacco products.
Who Gets Scoliosis?
People of all ages can have scoliosis, but this publication focuses on children and adolescents.
Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis scoliosis of unknown cause is the most common type and typically occurs after the age of 10.
Girls are more likely than boys to have this type of scoliosis.
Because scoliosis can run in families, a child who has a parent, brother, or sister with idiopathic scoliosis should be checked regularly for scoliosis by the family doctor.
What are the symptoms?
Symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus include problems with walking, impaired bladder control leading to urinary frequency and/or incontinence, and progressive mental impairment and dementia.
An individual with this type of hydrocephalus may have a general slowing of movements or may complain that his or her feet feel stuck.
Because some of these symptoms may also be experienced in other disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, normal pressure hydrocephalus is often incorrectly diagnosed and never properly treated.
Doctors may use a variety of tests, including brain scans such as computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI, a spinal tap or lumbar catheter, intracranial pressure monitoring, and neuropsychological tests, to help them accurately diagnose normal pressure hydrocephalus and rule out any other conditions.
What is Weight-bearing exercise?
Weight-bearing exercise is the best for your bones because it forces you to work against gravity.
What are the long-term complications of GERD for children and adolescents?
esophagitis - irritation of the esophagus from refluxed stomach acid that damages the lining and causes sores, called ulcers, or bleeding.
Children and adolescents who have chronic esophagitis over many years are more likely to develop precancerous changes in the esophagus during adulthood.
What is Niemann-Pick Disease?
Niemann-Pick disease NP refers to a group of inherited metabolic disorders known as lipid storage diseases.
Lipids fatty materials such as waxes, fatty acids, oils, and cholesterol and proteins are usually broken down into smaller components to provide energy for the body.
In Niemann-Pick disease, harmful quantities of lipids accumulate in the spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow, and the brain.
Symptoms may include lack of muscle coordination, brain degeneration, eye paralysis, learning problems, loss of muscle tone, increased sensitivity to touch, spasticity, feeding and swallowing difficulties, slurred speech, and an enlarged liver and spleen.
There may be clouding of the cornea and a characteristic cherry-red halo develops around the center of the retina.
The disease has 4 related types.
Type A, the most severe form, occurs in early infancy.
It is characterized by an enlarged liver and spleen, swollen lymph nodes, and profound brain damage by six months of age.
Children with this type rarely live beyond 18 months.
Type B involves an enlarged liver and spleen, which usually occurs in the pre-teen years.
The brain is not affected.
In types A and B, insufficient activity of an enzyme called sphingomyelinase causes the build up of toxic amounts of sphingomyelin, a fatty substance present in every cell of the body.
Types C and D may appear early in life or develop in the teen or adult years.
Affected individuals have only moderate enlargement of the spleen and liver, but brain damage may be extensive and cause an inability to look up and down, difficulty in walking and swallowing, and progressive loss of vision and hearing.
Types C and D are characterized by a defect that disrupts the transport of cholesterol between brain cells.
Type D usually occurs in people with an ancestral background in Nova Scotia.
Types C and D are caused by a lack of the NPC1 or NPC 2 proteins.
What is the prognosis for Spinal Cord Infarction?
Recovery depends upon how quickly treatment is received and how severely the body is compromised.
Paralysis may persist for many weeks or be permanent.
Most individuals have a good chance of recovery.
Why does a person need ostomy surgery of the bowel?
diverticulitis - - a condition that occurs when small pouches in the colon called diverticula become inflamed, or irritated and swollen, and infected.
Do children with AS get better?
With effective treatment, children with AS can learn to overcome their disabilities, but they may still find social situations and personal relationships challenging.
Many adults with Asperger syndrome work successfully in mainstream jobs, although they may continue to need encouragement and moral support to maintain an independent life.
What is Dementia?
Dementia is not a specific disease.
It is a descriptive term for a collection of symptoms that can be caused by a number of disorders that affect the brain.
People with dementia have significantly impaired intellectual functioning that interferes with normal activities and relationships.
They also lose their ability to solve problems and maintain emotional control, and they may experience personality changes and behavioral problems, such as agitation, delusions, and hallucinations.
While memory loss is a common symptom of dementia, memory loss by itself does not mean that a person has dementia.
Doctors diagnose dementia only if two or more brain functions - such as memory and language skills -- are significantly impaired without loss of consciousness.
Some of the diseases that can cause symptoms of dementia are Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington's disease, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
Doctors have identified other conditions that can cause dementia or dementia-like symptoms including reactions to medications, metabolic problems and endocrine abnormalities, nutritional deficiencies, infections, poisoning, brain tumors, anoxia or hypoxia conditions in which the brain's oxygen supply is either reduced or cut off entirely, and heart and lung problems.
Although it is common in very elderly individuals, dementia is not a normal part of the aging process.
What is A ureteroscope?
A ureteroscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing.
What is Prosopagnosia?
Prosopagnosia is a neurological disorder characterized by the inability to recognize faces.
What is the course of TS?
Tics come and go over time, varying in type, frequency, location, and severity.
The first symptoms usually occur in the head and neck area and may progress to include muscles of the trunk and extremities.
Motor tics generally precede the development of vocal tics and simple tics often precede complex tics.
Most patients experience peak tic severity before the mid-teen years with improvement for the majority of patients in the late teen years and early adulthood.
Approximately 10-15 percent of those affected have a progressive or disabling course that lasts into adulthood.
What research is being done for Spinal?
In May 2011, scientists funded in part by the National Institutes of Health reported that after intensive physical therapy and electrical stimulation to the spine, a man with a paralyzing spinal cord injury from the chest down had recovered the ability to stand and move paralyzed muscles at will when the stimulator is active.
The man participated in a pilot study that combined epidermal stimulation and locomotor training - involving his being suspended for hours a day in a harness, walking on a treadmill while physical therapists moved his legs in stepping motions.
Two years of locomotor training following his injury did not improve his ability to walk or stand.
But he did improve after December 2009, when electrodes were surgically implanted over the paralyzed area of his spinal cord and began sending rhythmic electrical bursts to neurons in the spinal cord during the locomotor training sessions.
This epidural simulation imitates the brain's sending signals to the spinal cord to begin movement.
He gradually became able to stand and fully bear his own weight for a few minutes at a time.
Although he can't walk without assistance, he can bend one leg at the knee and flex his ankle when the stimulator is active.
Locomotor training without any epidural stimulation is routinely used as a rehabilitative technique for people with spinal cord injuries - which allows some individuals to retain the ability to move and feel below the injury.
Meanwhile, a form of epidural stimulation is used to relieve pain for some individuals.
The researchers and NIH scientists caution that this finding was in only one person, and further study is required to confirm these early, promising results and to understand exactly how the stimulation is working.
What is a liver biopsy?
Laparoscopic biopsy involves inserting a laparoscope, a thin tube with a tiny video camera attached, through a small incision to look inside the body to view the surface of organs.
The health care provider will insert a needle through a plastic, tubelike instrument called a cannula to remove the liver tissue sample.
Is pregnancy safe for women with Crohn's disease?
Many women with Crohn's disease can become pregnant and have a baby.
However, if you are a woman with Crohn's disease, you should talk with your health care provider before getting pregnant.
What is Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia?
Hereditary spastic paraplegia HSP, also called familial spastic paraparesis FSP, refers to a group of inherited disorders that are characterized by progressive weakness and spasticity stiffness of the legs.
Early in the disease course, there may be mild gait difficulties and stiffness.
These symptoms typically slowly progress so that eventually individuals with HSP may require the assistance of a cane, walker, or wheelchair.
Though the primary features of pure HSP are progressive lower limb spasticity and weakness, complicated forms may be accompanied by other symptoms.
These additional impaired vision due to cataracts and problems with the optic nerve and retina of the eye, ataxia lack of muscle coordination, epilepsy, cognitive impairment, peripheral neuropathy, and deafness.
The diagnosis of HSP is primarily by neurological examination and testing to rule out other disorders.
Brain MRI abnormalities, such as a thin corpus callosum, may be seen in some of the complicated forms of HSP.
Several genetic mutations have been identified which underlie various forms of HSP, and specialized genetic testing and diagnosis are available at some medical centers.
HSP has several forms of inheritance.
Not all children in a family will necessarily develop symptoms, although they may be carriers of the abnormal gene.
Symptoms may begin in childhood or adulthood, depending on the particular HSP gene involved.
What is the prognosis for Cerebral Hypoxia?
Recovery depends on how long the brain has been deprived of oxygen and how much brain damage has occurred, although carbon monoxide poisoning can cause brain damage days to weeks after the event.
Most people who make a full recovery have only been briefly unconscious.
The longer someone is unconscious, the higher the chances of death or brain death and the lower the chances of a meaningful recovery.
During recovery, psychological and neurological abnormalities such as amnesia, personality regression, hallucinations, memory loss, and muscle spasms and twitches may appear, persist, and then resolve.
What are the large intestine, colon, rectum, and anus?
The large intestine, which includes the colon and rectum, is the last part of the digestive tract.
The large intestine's main job is to absorb water and hold stool.
The rectum connects the colon to the anus.
Stool passes out of the body through the anus.
At birth, the large intestine is about 2 feet long.
An adult's large intestine is about 5 feet long.
How Is Bronchiectasis Diagnosed?
Your doctor may suspect bronchiectasis if you have a daily cough that produces large amounts of sputum spit.
How Can I Join a Research Study?
There are many benefits to being part of a research study, such as getting related medical care at no charge and, in some cases, help with travel and other costs.
Also, study volunteers are seen by a team of experts and are often among the first to receive new treatments ahead of the general public.
Many volunteers take part in the research simply because they want to help others with the same disease, both today and in the future.
What is Physical activity?
Physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle.
Is there any treatment for Dermatomyositis?
There is no cure for dermatomyositis, but the symptoms can be treated.
Options include medication, physical therapy, exercise, heat therapy including microwave and ultrasound, orthotics and assistive devices, and rest.
The standard treatment for dermatomyositis is a corticosteroid drug, given either in pill form or intravenously.
Immunosuppressant drugs, such as azathioprine and methotrexate, may reduce inflammation in people who do not respond well to prednisone.
Periodic treatment using intravenous immunoglobulin can also improve recovery.
Other immunosuppressive agents used to treat the inflammation associated with dermatomyositis include cyclosporine A, cyclophosphamide, and tacrolimus.
Physical therapy is usually recommended to prevent muscle atrophy and to regain muscle strength and range of motion.
Many individuals with dermatomyositis may need a topical ointment, such as topical corticosteroids, for their skin disorder.
They should wear a high-protection sunscreen and protective clothing.
Surgery may be required to remove calcium deposits that cause nerve pain and recurrent infections.
What is the prognosis for Lissencephaly?
The prognosis for children with lissencephaly depends on the degree of brain malformation.
Many will die before the age of 10 years.
The cause of death is usually aspiration of food or fluids, respiratory disease, or severe seizures.
Some will survive, but show no significant development -- usually not beyond a 3- to 5-month-old level.
Others may have near-normal development and intelligence.
Because of this range, it is important to seek the opinion of specialists in lissencephaly and support from family groups with connection to these specialists.
What Is Pneumonia?
The infection inflames your lungs' air sacs, which are called alveoli al-VEE-uhl-eye.
The air sacs may fill up with fluid or pus, causing symptoms such as a cough with phlegm a slimy substance, fever, chills, and trouble breathing.
What is Infantile Neuroaxonal Dystrophy ?
Infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy INAD is a rare inherited neurological disorder.
It affects axons, the part of a nerve cell that carries messages from the brain to other parts of the body, and causes progressive loss of vision, muscular control, and mental skills.
While the basic genetic and metabolic causes are unknown, INAD is the result of an abnormal build-up of toxic substances in nerves that communicate with muscles, skin, and the conjunctive tissue around the eyes.
Symptoms usually begin within the first 2 years of life, with the loss of head control and the ability to sit, crawl, or walk, accompanied by deterioration in vision and speech.
Some children may have seizures.
Distinctive facial deformities may be present at birth, including a prominent forehead, crossed eyes, an unusually small nose or jaw, and large, low-set ears.
INAD is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means that both parents must be carriers of the defective gene that causes INAD to pass it on to their child.
Electrophysiology nerve conduction velocities may be helpful for diagnosis, although diagnosis is usually confirmed by tissue biopsy of skin, rectum, nerve or conjunctive tissue to confirm the presence of characteristic swellings spheroid bodies in the nerve axons.
What research is being done for Tardive Dyskinesia?

Who's at Risk?
Other at-risk groups include African Americans, American Indians, and Alaskan Natives.
African Americans between the ages of 5 and 19 are six times as likely to fatally drown in pools as whites or Hispanics.
Factors such as access to and use of swimming pools and lessons, and a combination of social and cultural issues, may contribute to the racial differences in fatal drowning rates.
If rates could be determined by actual participation in water-related activities, disparity in minorities fatal drowning rates compared to whites would be much greater.
How is gas treated?
Gas can be treated by reducing swallowed air, making dietary changes, or taking over-the-counter or prescription medications.
People who think they have too much gas can try to treat gas on their own before seeing a health care provider.

CDC will update this inventory on a regular basis in partnership with international influenza experts.
How is gastritis diagnosed?
The most common diagnostic test for gastritis is endoscopy with a biopsy of the stomach.
The doctor will usually give the patient medicine to reduce discomfort and anxiety before beginning the endoscopy procedure.
The doctor then inserts an endoscope, a thin tube with a tiny camera on the end, through the patient's mouth or nose and into the stomach.
The doctor uses the endoscope to examine the lining of the esophagus, stomach, and first portion of the small intestine.
If necessary, the doctor will use the endoscope to perform a biopsy, which involves collecting tiny samples of tissue for examination with a microscope.
Is there any treatment for Tarlov Cysts?
Tarlov cysts may be drained and shunted to relieve pressure and pain, but relief is often only temporary and fluid build-up in the cysts will recur.
Corticosteroid injections may also temporarily relieve pain.
Other drugs may be prescribed to treat chronic pain and depression.
Injecting the cysts with fibrin glue a combination of naturally occurring substances based on the clotting factor in blood may provide temporary relief of pain.
Some scientists believe the herpes simplex virus, which thrives in an alkaline environment, can cause Tarlov cysts to become symptomatic.

What do scientists know about myoclonus?
The specific mechanisms underlying myoclonus are not yet fully understood.
Scientists believe that some types of stimulus-sensitive myoclonus may involve overexcitability of the parts of the brain that control movement.
These parts are interconnected in a series of feedback loops called motor pathways.
These pathways facilitate and modulate communication between the brain and muscles.
Key elements of this communication are chemicals known as neurotransmitters, which carry messages from one nerve cell, or neuron, to another.
Neurotransmitters are released by neurons and attach themselves to receptors on parts of neighboring cells.
Some neurotransmitters may make the receiving cell more sensitive, while others tend to make the receiving cell less sensitive.
Laboratory studies suggest that an imbalance between these chemicals may underlie myoclonus.
What Causes Heart Disease?

What causes lower back pain?
Low back pain may reflect nerve or muscle irritation or bone lesions.
Most low back pain follows injury or trauma to the back, but pain may also be caused by degenerative conditions such as arthritis or disc disease, osteoporosis or other bone diseases, viral infections, irritation to joints and discs, or congenital abnormalities in the spine.
Obesity, smoking, weight gain during pregnancy, stress, poor physical condition, posture inappropriate for the activity being performed, and poor sleeping position also may contribute to low back pain.
Additionally, scar tissue created when the injured back heals itself does not have the strength or flexibility of normal tissue.
Buildup of scar tissue from repeated injuries eventually weakens the back and can lead to more serious injury.

What is the difference between Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C?
Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C are diseases caused by three different viruses.
Although each can cause similar symptoms, they have different modes of transmission and can affect the liver differently.
Hepatitis A appears only as an acute or newly occurring infection and does not become chronic.
People with Hepatitis A usually improve without treatment.
Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C can also begin as acute infections, but in some people, the virus remains in the body, resulting in chronic disease and long-term liver problems.
There are vaccines to prevent Hepatitis A and B; however, there is not one for Hepatitis C.
If a person has had one type of viral hepatitis in the past, it is still possible to get the other types.

In a few cases, in which pain is persistent or severe, surgical intervention may be indicated.
Who is at risk?
It is estimated that one in every 25,000 babies born in the United States will have some form of the mucopolysaccharidoses.
They are autosomal recessive disorders, meaning that only individuals inheriting the defective gene from both parents are affected.
The exception is MPS II, or Hunter syndrome, in which the mother alone passes along the defective gene to a son.
When both people in a couple have the defective gene, each pregnancy carries with it a one in four chance that the child will be affected.
The parents and siblings of an affected child may have no sign of the disorder.
Unaffected siblings and select relatives of a child with one of the mucopolysaccharidoses may carry the recessive gene and could pass it to their own children.
What is Carney triad?

What is Leigh's disease?
Leigh's disease is a rare inherited neurometabolic disorder that affects the central nervous system.
What research is being done for Friedreich's?
Studies have revealed that frataxin is an important mitochondrial protein for proper function of several organs.
Yet in people with the disease, the amount of frataxin in affected cells is severely reduced.
It is believed that the loss of frataxin makes the nervous system, heart, and pancreas particularly susceptible to damage from free radicals produced when the excess iron reacts with oxygen.
Once certain cells in these tissues are destroyed by free radicals they cannot be replaced.
Nerve and muscle cells also have metabolic needs that may make them particularly vulnerable to this damage.
Free radicals have been implicated in other degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.

For a 5-year period, all Strategic Alliance for Health communities focus their efforts on schools and one or more areas, such as community, work site, or health care sectors.
Also, the communities serve as mentors to other communities by developing and implementing action guides for evidence- and practice-based strategies that combat chronic diseases.
What are the symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease?
The neuropathy of CMT affects both motor and sensory nerves.
Motor nerves cause muscles to contract and control voluntary muscle activity such as speaking, walking, breathing, and swallowing.
A typical feature includes weakness of the foot and lower leg muscles, which may result in foot drop and a high-stepped gait with frequent tripping or falls.
Foot deformities, such as high arches and hammertoes a condition in which the middle joint of a toe bends upwards are also characteristic due to weakness of the small muscles in the feet.
In addition, the lower legs may take on an inverted champagne bottle appearance due to the loss of muscle bulk.
Later in the disease, weakness and muscle atrophy may occur in the hands, resulting in difficulty with carrying out fine motor skills the coordination of small movements usually in the fingers, hands, wrists, feet, and tongue.
How Can Osteoporosis Be Prevented?
Talk to your doctor if you have a family history of osteoporosis or other factors that may put you at increased risk for the disease.
Your doctor may suggest that you have your bone density measured through a safe test that can determine your risk for fractures broken bones and measure your response to osteoporosis treatment.

If an x ray is needed, the technician will take extra steps to protect the fetus from radiation.
What is the prognosis for Spinal Cord Injury?
Spinal cord injuries are classified as either complete or incomplete.
An incomplete injury means that the ability of the spinal cord to convey messages to or from the brain is not completely lost.
People with incomplete injuries retain some motor or sensory function below the injury.
A complete injury is indicated by a total lack of sensory and motor function below the level of injury.
People who survive a spinal cord injury will most likely have medical complications such as chronic pain and bladder and bowel dysfunction, along with an increased susceptibility to respiratory and heart problems.
Successful recovery depends upon how well these chronic conditions are handled day to day.

The use of wide elastic belts that can be tightened to 'pull in' lumbar and abdominal muscles to prevent low back pain remains controversial.
A landmark study of the use of lumbar support or abdominal support belts worn by persons who lift or move merchandise found no evidence that the belts reduce back injury or back pain.
The 2-year study, reported by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health NIOSH in December 2000, found no statistically significant difference in either the incidence of workers' compensation claims for job-related back injuries or the incidence of self-reported pain among workers who reported they wore back belts daily compared to those workers who reported never using back belts or reported using them only once or twice a month.

Why Are ASDs Increasing?
At CDC, we know that people want answers to what is causing this increase, and so do we.
The reasons for the increase in the identified prevalence of ASDs are not understood completely.
Some of the increase is due to the way children are identified, diagnosed, and served in their local communities, although exactly how much is due to these factors is unknown.
Also, it is likely that reported increases are explained partly by greater awareness by doctors, teachers, and parents.
To understand more, CDC will keep guiding and conducting research into what is putting our children at risk.

How are the peripheral neuropathies classified?
More than 100 types of peripheral neuropathy have been identified, each with its own characteristic set of symptoms, pattern of development, and prognosis.
Impaired function and symptoms depend on the type of nerves-motor, sensory, or autonomic-that are damaged.
Motor nerves control movements of all muscles under conscious control, such as those used for walking, grasping things, or talking.
Sensory nerves transmit information about sensory experiences, such as the feeling of a light touch or the pain resulting from a cut.
Autonomic nerves regulate biological activities that people do not control consciously, such as breathing, digesting food, and heart and gland functions.
Although some neuropathies may affect all three types of nerves, others primarily affect one or two types.
Therefore, doctors may use terms such as predominantly motor neuropathy, predominantly sensory neuropathy, sensory-motor neuropathy, or autonomic neuropathy to describe a patient's condition.
What is High blood pressure?

What are Hereditary Neuropathies?
Hereditary neuropathies are a group of inherited disorders affecting the peripheral nervous system.
The hereditary neuropathies are divided into four major subcategories: hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy, hereditary sensory neuropathy, hereditary motor neuropathy, and hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy.
The most common type is Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, one of the hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies.
Symptoms of the hereditary neuropathies vary according to the type and may include sensory symptoms such as numbness, tingling, and pain in the feet and hands; or motor symptoms such as weakness and loss of muscle bulk, particularly in the lower leg and feet muscles.
Certain types of hereditary neuropathies can affect the autonomic nerves, resulting in impaired sweating, postural hypotension, or insensitivity to pain.
Some people may have foot deformities such as high arches and hammer toes, thin calf muscles having the appearance of an inverted champagne glass or scoliosis curvature of the spine.
The symptoms of hereditary neuropathies may be apparent at birth or appear in middle or late life.
They can vary among different family members, with some family members being more severely affected than others.
The hereditary neuropathies can be diagnosed by blood tests for genetic testing, nerve conduction studies, and nerve biopsies.

What is the prognosis for Colpocephaly?
The prognosis for individuals with colpocephaly depends on the severity of the associated conditions and the degree of abnormal brain development.
Some children benefit from special education.
What are the symptoms?
Most cerebral aneurysms do not show symptoms until they either become very large or burst.
Small, unchanging aneurysms generally will not produce symptoms, whereas a larger aneurysm that is steadily growing may press on tissues and nerves.
Symptoms may include pain above and behind the eye; numbness, weakness, or paralysis on one side of the face; dilated pupils; and vision changes.
When an aneurysm hemorrhages, an individual may experience a sudden and extremely severe headache, double vision, nausea, vomiting, stiff neck, and/or loss of consciousness.
Individuals usually describe the headache as 'the worst headache of my life' and it is generally different in severity and intensity from other headaches people may experience.
'Sentinel' or warning headaches may result from an aneurysm that leaks for days to weeks prior to rupture.
Only a minority of individuals have a sentinel headache prior to aneurysm rupture.
What happens during a well-woman visit?
Your well-woman visit is a chance to focus on your overall health and wellness.

How is syringomyelia diagnosed?
Diagnostic imaging has significantly increased the number of syringomyelia cases detected in the beginning stages of the disorder.
Physicians primarily use magnetic resonance imaging MRI to diagnose syringomyelia.
Computer-generated radio waves and a powerful magnetic field produce images of body structures, such as the brain and spinal cord, in vivid detail.
This test will show the syrinx in the spine as well as other conditions, such as the presence of a tumor.
Images taken in rapid succession can be used for 'dynamic imaging' in 'cine mode' to observe the fluid flowing around the spinal cord and within the syrinx.
Computed tomography CT, which uses x-rays and a computerized scanner to produce cross-sectional images of the body or an organ structure, may reveal the presence of tumors and other abnormalities such as hydrocephalus.
Another test, called a myelogram, takes x-ray-like pictures and requires a contrast medium or dye to do so.
Since the introduction of MRI this test is rarely necessary to diagnose syringomyelia.
Where is Hepatitis E?

These are signs of infection.
How are the mucolipidoses diagnosed?
Prenatal diagnosis for ML is accomplished using a procedure known as chorionic villus sampling, or CVS.
It is usually done around the 8th or 10th week of pregnancy and involves removing and testing a very small sample of the placenta.
For ML types I, II, and III, placental cells called amniocytes are grown in culture and then tested to measure enzyme activity levels.
For ML IV, no culture is required.
DNA is obtained directly from the amniocytes and analyzed to find if mutations consistent with ML IV have occurred in the DNA.
This technique is called genotyping.
What research is being done for Restless Legs Syndrome?

Can you get Hepatitis C by getting a tattoo or piercing?
A few major research studies have not shown Hepatitis C to be spread through licensed, commercial tattooing facilities.
However, transmission of Hepatitis C and other infectious diseases is possible when poor infection-control practices are used during tattooing or piercing.
Body art is becoming increasingly popular in the United States, and unregulated tattooing and piercing are known to occur in prisons and other informal or unregulated settings.
Further research is needed to determine if these types of settings and exposures are responsible for Hepatitis C virus transmission.
What is Infantile Refsum Disease?
Infantile Refsum disease IRD is a medical condition within the Zellweger spectrum of perixisome biogenesis disorders PBDs, inherited genetic disorders that damage the white matter of the brain and affect motor movements.
PBDs are part of a larger group of disorders called the leukodystrophies.
The Zellweger spectrum of PBDs include related, but not more severe, disorders referred to as Zellweger syndrome ZS and neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy.
Collectively, these disorders are caused by inherited defects in any one of 12 genes, called PEX genes, which are required for the normal formation and function of peroxisomes.
Peroxisomes are cell structures required for the normal formation and function of the brain, eyes, liver, kidneys, and bone.
They contain enzymes that break down toxic substances in the cells, including very long chain fatty acids and phytanic acid a type of fat found in certain foods, and synthesize certain fatty materials lipids that are required for cell function.
When peroxisomes are not functioning, there is over-accumulation of very long chain fatty acids and phytanic acid, and a lack of bile acids and plasmalogens--specialized lipids found in cell membranes and the myelin sheaths and encase and protect nerve fibers.
IRD has some residual perixisome function, resulting in less severe disease than in Zellweger syndrome.
Symptoms of IRD begin in infancy with retinitis pigmentosa, a visual impairment that often leads to blindness, and hearing problems that usually progress to deafness by early childhood.
Other symptoms may include rapid, jerky eye movements nystagmus; floppy muscle tone hypotonia and lack of muscle coordination ataxia; mental and growth disabilities; abnormal facial features; enlarged liver; and white matter abnormalities of brain myelin.
At the mildest extreme of the disorder, intellect may be preserved.
Although Adult Refsum disease and IRD have similar names, they are separate disorders caused by different gene defects.

Is it true that muscle weighs more than fat? If so, will I gain weight when I start strength training if I don't go on a diet?
Unless you increase the amount of calories you are eating, it is very unlikely that you will gain weight or become bulky.
Here's why: one pound equals one pound regardless of whether the pound is fat, muscle, or some other substance like butter or steel.
Muscle is denser and therefore takes up a smaller amount of space per pound than fat.
Some scientists estimate that the space that one pound of muscle occupies is about 22% less than one pound of fat! If you begin strength training and continue to eat the same number of calories, you may lose some weight because you're burning additional calories while exercising.
The important thing about strength training is the change in body composition.
You will gain muscle and most likely decrease body fat even if your body weight stays the same.
In our experience, people might drop a size or two after they have been strength training for a couple of months because their body shape has changed for the better.
If your goal in starting strength training is to gain weight, we recommend you also increase the number of calories you are consuming.
Try adding an extra fruit, vegetable, low-fat dairy and/or whole grain serving to your daily diet.
What is A related procedure?
A related procedure is an occlusion, in which the surgeon clamps off occludes the entire artery that leads to the aneurysm.

African Americans, Hispanic/Latino, American Indians, and some Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are at particularly high risk for type 2 diabetes.
What is Cerebral Atrophy?
Cerebral atrophy is a common feature of many of the diseases that affect the brain.
Atrophy of any tissue means loss of cells.
In brain tissue, atrophy describes a loss of neurons and the connections between them.
Atrophy can be generalized, which means that all of the brain has shrunk; or it can be focal, affecting only a limited area of the brain and resulting in a decrease of the functions that area of the brain controls.
If the cerebral hemispheres the two lobes of the brain that form the cerebrum are affected, conscious thought and voluntary processes may be impaired.
What is Multiple Sclerosis?
Most people experience their first symptoms of MS between the ages of 20 and 40; the initial symptom of MS is often blurred or double vision, red-green color distortion, or even blindness in one eye.
Most MS patients experience muscle weakness in their extremities and difficulty with coordination and balance.
These symptoms may be severe enough to impair walking or even standing.
In the worst cases, MS can produce partial or complete paralysis.
Most people with MS also exhibit paresthesias, transitory abnormal sensory feelings such as numbness, prickling, or pins and needles sensations.
Some may also experience pain.
Speech impediments, tremors, and dizziness are other frequent complaints.
Occasionally, people with MS have hearing loss.
Approximately half of all people with MS experience cognitive impairments such as difficulties with concentration, attention, memory, and poor judgment, but such symptoms are usually mild and are frequently overlooked.
Depression is another common feature of MS.

How Is Heart Block Diagnosed?
Heart block might be diagnosed as part of a routine doctor's visit or during an emergency situation.
Third-degree heart block often is an emergency..
How are febrile seizures diagnosed and treated?
Before diagnosing febrile seizures in infants and children, doctors sometimes perform tests to be sure that seizures are not caused by something other than simply the fever itself.
For example, if a doctor suspects the child has meningitis an infection of the membranes surrounding the brain, a spinal tap may be needed to check for signs of the infection in the cerebrospinal fluid fluid that bathes the brain and spinal cord.
If there has been severe diarrhea or vomiting, dehydration could be responsible for seizures.
Also, doctors often perform other tests such as examining the blood and urine to pinpoint the cause of the child's fever.
What is High blood pressure?
High blood pressure is the most important risk factor for stroke.
How Can Pericarditis Be Prevented?

What is the prognosis for Complex Regional Pain Syndrome?
The prognosis for CRPS varies from person to person.
Spontaneous remission from symptoms occurs in certain individuals.
Others can have unremitting pain and crippling, irreversible changes in spite of treatment.
What is the prognosis for Central Pontine Myelinolysis?
The prognosis for myelinolysis is variable.
Some individuals die and others recover completely.
Although the disorder was originally considered to have a mortality rate of 50 percent or more, improved imaging techniques and early diagnosis have led to a better prognosis for many people.
Most individuals improve gradually, but still continue to have challenges with speech, walking, emotional ups and downs, and forgetfulness.
Is there any treatment for Reye's Syndrome?
There is no cure for RS.
Successful management, which depends on early diagnosis, is primarily aimed at protecting the brain against irreversible damage by reducing brain swelling, reversing the metabolic injury, preventing complications in the lungs, and anticipating cardiac arrest.
It has been learned that several inborn errors of metabolism mimic RS in that the first manifestation of these errors may be an encephalopathy with liver dysfunction.
These disorders must be considered in all suspected cases of RS.
Some evidence suggests that treatment in the end stages of RS with hypertonic IV glucose solutions may prevent progression of the syndrome.
What isH.
pylori?
H.
pylori causes more than half of peptic ulcers worldwide.
The bacterium causes peptic ulcers by damaging the mucous coating that protects the stomach and duodenum.
Damage to the mucous coating allows powerful stomach acid to get through to the sensitive lining beneath.
Together, the stomach acid and H.
pylori irritate the lining of the stomach or duodenum and cause an ulcer.
Is there any treatment for Primary Lateral Sclerosis?
Treatment for individuals with PLS is symptomatic.
Muscle relaxants such as baclofen, tizanidine, and the benzodiazepines may reduce spasticity.
Other drugs may relieve pain and antidepressants can help treat depression.
Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and rehabilitation may prevent joint immobility and slow muscle weakness and atrophy.
Assistive devices such as supports or braces, speech synthesizers, and wheelchairs ma help some people retain independence.
Speech therapy may be useful for those with involvement of the facial muscles.
How is COPD treated?
Treatment of COPD requires a careful and thorough evaluation by a physician.
COPD treatment can alleviate symptoms, decrease the frequency and severity of exacerbations, and increase exercise tolerance.
For those who smoke, the most important aspect of treatment is smoking cessation.
Avoiding tobacco smoke and removing other air pollutants from the patient's home or workplace are also important.
Symptoms such as coughing or wheezing can be treated with medication.
Pulmonary rehabilitation is an individualized treatment program that teaches COPD management strategies to increase quality of life.
Plans may include breathing strategies, energy-conserving techniques, and nutritional counseling.
The flu can cause serious problems in people with COPD.
Vaccination during flu season is recommended and respiratory infections should be treated with antibiotics, if appropriate.
Patients who have low blood oxygen levels are often given supplemental oxygen.
How are these disorders diagnosed?
Based on the results of the individual's medical history and a general physical exam, the physician will conduct a thorough neurological exam to assess various functions: motor and sensory skills, nerve function, hearing and speech, vision, coordination and balance, mental status, and changes in mood or behavior.
The physician may order laboratory tests and one or more of the following procedures to help diagnose neurological complications of AIDS.
What is Lofgren's syndrome?
Lofgren's syndrome is a classic set of signs and symptoms that occur in some people when they first have sarcoidosis.
Is there any treatment for Dystonias?
No one treatment has been found to be universally effective.
Instead, doctors use a variety of therapies medications, surgery, and other treatments such as physical therapy, splinting, stress management, and biofeedback aimed at reducing or eliminating muscle spasms and pain.
Since response to drugs varies among individuals and even in the same person over time, the most effective therapy is often individualized.
What is a Stroke?
A stroke, or brain attack, occurs when blood circulation to the brain fails.
Brain cells can die from decreased blood flow and the resulting lack of oxygen.
There are two broad categories of stroke: those caused by a blockage of blood flow and those caused by bleeding into the brain.
A blockage of a blood vessel in the brain or neck, called an ischemic stroke, is the most frequent cause of stroke and is responsible for about 80 percent of strokes.
These blockages stem from three conditions: the formation of a clot within a blood vessel of the brain or neck, called thrombosis; the movement of a clot from another part of the body such as the heart to the brain, called embolism; or a severe narrowing of an artery in or leading to the brain, called stenosis.
Bleeding into the brain or the spaces surrounding the brain causes the second type of stroke, called hemorrhagic stroke.
What is Colonic atresia?
Colonic atresia is an extremely rare congenital anomaly that occurs when a section of the colon closes before birth.
What Are the Risks of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention?
Percutaneous coronary intervention PCI is a common medical procedure.
Serious complications don't occur often.
However, they can happen no matter how careful your doctor is or how well he or she does the procedure.
What is the prognosis for Dysautonomia?
The outlook for individuals with dysautonomia depends on the particular diagnostic category.
People with chronic, progressive, generalized dysautonomia in the setting of central nervous system degeneration have a generally poor long-term prognosis.
Death can occur from pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, or sudden cardiopulmonary arrest.
When do I need to see a doctor?
Have a fever higher than 101.5 degree F degrees Fahrenheit.
What is Intussusception?
Intussusception is a condition in which one section of either the large or small intestine folds into itself, much like a collapsible telescope.
What is the prognosis for Gerstmann's Syndrome?

He or she also may recommend CABG if you have severe blockages in your large coronary heart arteries, especially if your heart's pumping action has already grown weak.
What Is Osteoporosis?
Osteoporosis is a condition in which the bones become less dense and more likely to fracture.
Fractures from osteoporosis can result in significant pain and disability.
In the United States, more than 40 million people either already have osteoporosis or are at high risk due to low bone mass.
Although postmenopausal Caucasian women have the highest risk for the disease, men and certain ethnic populations are also at risk.
What are the symptoms?
stroke or transient ischemic attack TIA, sometimes also called a 'mini-stroke'.
How do people getSalmonella infections from live poultry?
People become infected with Salmonella when they put their hands or other things that have been in contact with feces in or around their mouth.
Young children are especially at risk for illness because their immune systems are still developing and because they are more likely than others to put their fingers or other items into their mouths.
It is important to wash hands immediately after touching poultry or anything in the area where they live and roam, because the germs on your hands can easily spread to other people or things.
What Is Anemia?
Anemia also can occur if your red blood cells don't contain enough hemoglobin HEE-muh-glow-bin.
Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color.
This protein helps red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.
What causes peripheral neuropathy?
Peripheral neuropathy may be either inherited or acquired.
Causes of acquired peripheral neuropathy include physical injury trauma to a nerve, tumors, toxins, autoimmune responses, nutritional deficiencies, alcoholism, and vascular and metabolic disorders.
Acquired peripheral neuropathies are grouped into three broad categories: those caused by systemic disease, those caused by trauma from external agents, and those caused by infections or autoimmune disorders affecting nerve tissue.
One example of an acquired peripheral neuropathy is trigeminal neuralgia also known as tic douloureux, in which damage to the trigeminal nerve the large nerve of the head and face causes episodic attacks of excruciating, lightning-like pain on one side of the face.
In some cases, the cause is an earlier viral infection, pressure on the nerve from a tumor or swollen blood vessel, or, infrequently, multiple sclerosis.
In many cases, however, a specific cause cannot be identified.
Doctors usually refer to neuropathies with no known cause as idiopathic neuropathies.
If I test positive for Chagas disease, can I give blood again?
No.
You cannot donate again if you've tested positive for Chagas disease.
What are the complications and treatment of a burst appendix?
Sometimes an abscess forms around a burst appendix - called an appendiceal abscess.
A surgeon may drain the pus from the abscess during surgery or, more commonly, before surgery.
To drain an abscess, a tube is placed in the abscess through the abdominal wall.
The drainage tube is left in place for about 2 weeks while antibiotics are given to treat infection.
Six to 8 weeks later, when infection and inflammation are under control, surgeons operate to remove what remains of the burst appendix.

Hepatitis C can be either 'acute' or 'chronic.'
What Research Is Being Conducted on Heritable Disorders of Connective Tissue?
NIAMS-supported researchers have succeeded in healing wounds in a mouse model of a particularly severe form of epidermolysis bullosa called recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa RDEB by injecting the mice with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa patient cells in which the gene defect has been corrected.
This approach may be useful in developing therapies for the disease.
Other NIAMS-supported research shows it may be possible to grow healthy new skin in the lab for people with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa by using skin cells from patients that were modified to express a normal gene for type VII collagen.
Having successfully transplanted the modified skin on mice, scientists can now try to grow larger sheets of skin and graft them back onto people affected by recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa.

What is Chronic Pain?
While acute pain is a normal sensation triggered in the nervous system to alert you to possible injury and the need to take care of yourself, chronic pain is different.
Chronic pain persists.
Pain signals keep firing in the nervous system for weeks, months, even years.
There may have been an initial mishap -- sprained back, serious infection, or there may be an ongoing cause of pain -- arthritis, cancer, ear infection, but some people suffer chronic pain in the absence of any past injury or evidence of body damage.
Many chronic pain conditions affect older adults.
Common chronic pain complaints include headache, low back pain, cancer pain, arthritis pain, neurogenic pain pain resulting from damage to the peripheral nerves or to the central nervous system itself, psychogenic pain pain not due to past disease or injury or any visible sign of damage inside or outside the nervous system.
A person may have two or more co-existing chronic pain conditions.
Such conditions can include chronic fatigue syndrome, endometriosis, fibromyalgia, inflammatory bowel disease, interstitial cystitis, temporomandibular joint dysfunction, and vulvodynia.
It is not known whether these disorders share a common cause.
What Type of Doctor Diagnoses and Treats Paget's Disease?

What is irritable bowel syndrome IBS?
Irritable bowel syndrome is a functional gastrointestinal GI disorder, meaning it is a problem caused by changes in how the GI tract works.
Children with a functional GI disorder have frequent symptoms, but the GI tract does not become damaged.
IBS is not a disease; it is a group of symptoms that occur together.
The most common symptoms of IBS are abdominal pain or discomfort, often reported as cramping, along with diarrhea, constipation, or both.
In the past, IBS was called colitis, mucous colitis, spastic colon, nervous colon, and spastic bowel.
The name was changed to reflect the understanding that the disorder has both physical and mental causes and is not a product of a person's imagination.

Severe arrhythmias can damage the body's vital organs and may even cause loss of consciousness or death.
What is Angiography?
Angiography is a test used to detect blockages of the arteries or veins.
What are the complications of spina bifida?
Complications of spina bifida can range from minor physical problems with little functional impairment to severe physical and mental disabilities.
It is important to note, however, that most people with spina bifida are of normal intelligence.
Spina bifida's impact is determined by the size and location of the malformation, whether it covered, and which spinal nerves are involved.
All nerves located below the malformation are affected to some degree.
Therefore, the higher the malformation occurs on the back, the greater the amount of nerve damage and loss of muscle function and sensation.
What is Pediatric follicular lymphoma?
Pediatric follicular lymphoma is a disease that differs from the adult counterpart genetically and clinically.
What is the prognosis for Opsoclonus Myoclonus?

The symptoms sometimes recur without warning.
Generally the disorder is not fatal.
What is liver transplant rejection and how is it treated?
Rejection occurs when a person's immune system recognizes the transplanted liver as 'foreign' and tries to destroy it.
Rejection commonly occurs a week or two after a transplant, although rejection can occur at any time that immunosuppressive medications fail to control the patient's immune reaction.
Rejection does not always cause noticeable symptoms.
Elevated liver enzyme levels in the blood may be the first sign that rejection is occurring.
Other signs and symptoms of rejection may include fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, abdominal tenderness or pain, fever, jaundice, dark-colored urine, or lightcolored stools.
If my blood tests positive on the screening test, does that mean I have Chagas disease?

Polycythemia vera PV is a rare blood disease.
What is a continent ileostomy?
A continent ileostomy is an internal pouch, sometimes called a Kock pouch, fashioned from the end of the ileum just before it exits the abdominal wall as an ileostomy.
The surgeon makes a valve inside the pouch so that intestinal contents do not flow out.
The person drains the pouch each day by inserting a thin, flexible tube, called a catheter, through the stoma.
The person covers the stoma with a simple patch or dressing.
A continent ileostomy is an option for people who are not good candidates for an ileoanal reservoir because of damage to the rectum or anus and who do not want to wear an ostomy pouch.

The Institute of Medicine IOM of the National Academy of Sciences recommends 1,000 mg milligrams of calcium daily for adults age 19 to 50.
Women over age 50 and men over age 70 should increase their intake to 1,200 mg daily.
To help your body use the calcium, the IOM recommends 600 International Units IU of vitamin D up to age 70 and 800 IU after 70.
What research is being done for Myoclonus?
Investigators are evaluating the role of neurotransmitters and receptors in myoclonus.
If abnormalities in neurotransmitters or receptors are found to play a causative role in myoclonus, future research can focus on determining the extent to which genetic alterations are responsible for these abnormalities and on identifying the nature of those alterations.
Scientists also may be able to develop drug treatments that target specific changes in the receptors to reverse abnormalities, such as the loss of inhibition, and to enhance mechanisms that compensate for these abnormalities.
Identifying receptor abnormalities also may help researchers develop diagnostic tests for myoclonus.
NINDS-supported scientists at research institutions throughout the country are studying various aspects of PME, including the basic mechanisms and genes involved in this group of diseases.
What is Syringomyelia?
Syringomyelia sear-IN-go-my-EEL-ya is a disorder in which a cyst forms within the spinal cord.
This cyst, called a syrinx, expands and elongates over time, destroying the center of the spinal cord.
Since the spinal cord connects the brain to nerves in the extremities, this damage results in pain, weakness, and stiffness in the back, shoulders, arms, or legs.
Other symptoms may include headaches and a loss of the ability to feel extremes of hot or cold, especially in the hands.
Each patient experiences a different combination of symptoms.
Magnetic resonance imaging MRI has significantly increased the number of syringomyelia cases diagnosed in the beginning stages of the disorder.
Signs of the disorder tend to develop slowly, although sudden onset may occur with coughing or straining.
If not treated surgically, syringomyelia often leads to progressive weakness in the arms and legs, loss of hand sensation, and chronic, severe pain.
In most cases, the disorder is related to a congenital abnormality of the brain called a Chiari I malformation.
This malformation occurs during the development of the fetus and causes the lower part of the cerebellum to protrude from its normal location in the back of the head into the cervical or neck portion of the spinal canal.
Syringomyelia may occur as a complication of trauma, meningitis, hemorrhage, a tumor, or arachnoiditis.
Symptoms may appear months or even years after the initial injury, starting with pain, weakness, and sensory impairment originating at the site of trauma.
Some cases of syringomyelia are familial, although this is rare.
What is Abdominal surgery?
Abdominal surgery is the most frequent cause of abdominal adhesions.
How are inguinal hernias treated?
Repair of an inguinal hernia via surgery is the only treatment for inguinal hernias and can prevent incarceration and strangulation.
Health care providers recommend surgery for most people with inguinal hernias and especially for people with hernias that cause symptoms.
Research suggests that men with hernias that cause few or no symptoms may be able to safely delay surgery until their symptoms increase.
Men who delay surgery should watch for symptoms and see a health care provider regularly.
Health care providers usually recommend surgery for infants and children to prevent incarceration.
Emergent, or immediate, surgery is necessary for incarcerated or strangulated hernias.
What is the prognosis for Pompe Disease?
Without enzyme replacement therapy, the hearts of babies with infantile onset Pompe disease progressively thicken and enlarge.
These babies die before the age of one year from either cardiorespiratory failure or respiratory infection.
For individuals with late onset Pompe disease, the prognosis is dependent upon the age of onset.
In general, the later the age of onset, the slower the progression of the disease.
Ultimately, the prognosis is dependent upon the extent of respiratory muscle involvement.

The prognosis for individuals with schizencephaly varies depending on the size of the clefts and the extent of neurological disabilities.
What is an ileostomy?
An ileostomy is a stoma created from a part of the ileum.
For this surgery, the surgeon brings the ileum through the abdominal wall to make a stoma.
An ileostomy may be permanent or temporary.
An ileostomy is permanent when the surgeon removes or bypasses the entire colon, rectum, and anus.
A surgeon may perform a temporary ileostomy for a damaged or an inflamed colon or rectum that only needs time to rest or heal from injury or surgery.
After the colon or rectum heals, the surgeon repairs the opening in the abdominal wall and reconnects the ileum so stool will pass into the colon normally.
An ileostomy is the most common temporary bowel diversion.
A surgeon performs an ileostomy most often to treat inflammatory bowel disease or rectal cancer.
What is A blood transfusion?
A blood transfusion is a common procedure in which blood is given to you through an intravenous IV line in one of your blood vessels.

Second-look laparotomy is a surgical procedure to find out if tumor cells are left after primary treatment.
What Is Osteoporosis? Isn't It Something Old People Get?
Osteoporosis is a disease that causes bones to become fragile and break easily.
When someone has osteoporosis, it means his/her 'bank account' of bone tissue has dropped to a low level.
If there is significant bone loss, even sneezing or bending over to tie a shoe can cause a bone in the spine to break.
Hips, ribs, and wrist bones also break easily.
The fractures from osteoporosis can be painful and disfiguring.
There is no cure for the disease.
What is A pediatric cardiologist?
A pediatric cardiologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating heart problems in children.

What is Diabetic Neuropathy?
Diabetic neuropathy is a peripheral nerve disorder caused by diabetes or poor blood sugar control.
The most common types of diabetic neuropathy result in problems with sensation in the feet.
It can develop slowly after many years of diabetes or may occur early in the disease.
The symptoms are numbness, pain, or tingling in the feet or lower legs.
The pain can be intense and require treatment to relieve the discomfort.
The loss of sensation in the feet may also increase the possibility that foot injuries will go unnoticed and develop into ulcers or lesions that become infected.
In some cases, diabetic neuropathy can be associated with difficulty walking and some weakness in the foot muscles.
There are other types of diabetic-related neuropathies that affect specific parts of the body.
For example, diabetic amyotrophy causes pain, weakness and wasting of the thigh muscles, or cranial nerve infarcts that may result in double vision, a drooping eyelid, or dizziness.
Diabetes can also affect the autonomic nerves that control blood pressure, the digestive tract, bladder function, and sexual organs.
Problems with the autonomic nerves may cause lightheadedness, indigestion, diarrhea or constipation, difficulty with bladder control, and impotence.
What Is a Coronary Calcium Scan?
If the plaque ruptures, a blood clot can form on its surface.
A large blood clot can mostly or completely block blood flow through a coronary artery.
This is the most common cause of a heart attack.
Over time, ruptured plaque also hardens and narrows the coronary arteries.
What research is being done for Dysautonomia?
The NINDS supports and conducts research on dysautonomia.
This research aims to discover ways to diagnose, treat, and, ultimately, prevent these disorders.
What is Osteoporosis?

Can these experiments be done safely using containment provided by BSL-3 with enhancements?
A BSL-3 facility with specific enhancements includes primary safety cabinets, isolation cabinets, gloves, gowns and secondary facility construction barriers to protect laboratory workers and the public from accidental exposure.
Specific enhancements include change-of-clothing and shower-out requirements, and the use of a powered air purifying respirator PAPR; half body suits.
The primary and secondary barriers plus additional personal safety practices provide appropriate containment for conducting such influenza research.
CDC evaluated the specific studies to be conducted as well as the highly experienced scientific team conducting the research and concluded that this work could proceed under BSL-3 containment with enhancements.
What is Losing weight?
Losing weight is the first step.
What are porphyrias?
Porphyrias are rare disorders that affect mainly the skin or nervous system and may cause abdominal pain.
These disorders are usually inherited, meaning they are caused by abnormalities in genes passed from parents to children.
When a person has a porphyria, cells fail to change body chemicals called porphyrins and porphyrin precursors into heme, the substance that gives blood its red color.
The body makes heme mainly in the bone marrow and liver.
Bone marrow is the soft, spongelike tissue inside the bones; it makes stem cells that develop into one of the three types of blood cells - red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
What are gallstones?
Gallstones can range in size from a grain of sand to a golf ball.
The gallbladder can develop a single large gallstone, hundreds of tiny stones, or both small and large stones.
Gallstones can cause sudden pain in the upper right abdomen.
This pain, called a gallbladder attack or biliary colic, occurs when gallstones block the ducts of the biliary tract.

Some of the most common triggers are:
What should you expect before Chest MRI?
Are you pregnant or do you think you could be? Generally, you shouldn't have a chest MRI if you're pregnant, especially during the first trimester.
Sometimes, though, an MRI is needed to help diagnose a serious condition that may harm you or your baby.
If you're pregnant, discuss the risks and benefits of an MRI with your doctor.
How should the H5N1 inventory be used?
The inventory of H5N1 genetic changes is intended for use by researchers conducting influenza surveillance and research on H5N1 viruses in humans and animals.
The H5N1 Inventory should be used as a reference for the identification of specific genetic changes in naturally-occurring H5N1 viruses that may indicate adaptation to mammalian species or altered susceptibility to existing influenza antiviral drugs.
Because adaptation of H5N1 viruses to mammalian species may occur through multiple pathways, surveillance and research teams that identify viruses with multiple genetic changes should alert a relevant WHO Collaborating Center or an H5N1 reference laboratory and submit the virus for further characterization and for risk assessment.
Contact information for these laboratories can be found at the WHO website.
What Are Possible Complications of Hip Replacement Surgery?
The most common later complication of hip replacement surgery is an inflammatory reaction to tiny particles that gradually wear off of the artificial joint surfaces and are absorbed by the surrounding tissues.
The inflammation may trigger the action of special cells that eat away some of the bone, causing the implant to loosen.
To treat this complication, the doctor may use anti-inflammatory medications or recommend revision surgery replacement of an artificial joint.
Medical scientists are experimenting with new materials that last longer and cause less inflammation.
Less common complications of hip replacement surgery include infection, blood clots, and heterotopic bone formation bone growth beyond the normal edges of bone.
What is the risk to humans from this virus?
However, human infections with new influenza viruses against which the human population has little immunity would be concerning if they occurred.
Influenza viruses are constantly changing and it is possible for a virus to change so that it could infect humans and spread easily between humans.
Such a virus could represent a pandemic influenza threat.
For this reason, CDC and its partners are monitoring the H3N8 influenza virus as well as other animal influenza viruses along with instances of possible human exposure to these viruses very closely.
In general, however, canine influenza viruses are considered to pose a low threat to humans.
As mentioned earlier, while these viruses are well established in horse and dog populations, there is no evidence of infection among humans with this virus.
How common is IBS in children?
Limited information is available about the number of children with IBS.
Older studies have reported prevalence rates for recurrent abdominal pain in children of 10 to 20 percent.
However, these studies did not differentiate IBS from functional abdominal pain, indigestion, and abdominal migraine.
One study of children in North America found that 14 percent of high school students and 6 percent of middle school students have IBS.
The study also found that IBS affects boys and girls equally.
What is Fibromyalgia?
Fibromyalgia is a chronic disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and multiple 'tender points,' particularly in the neck, spine, shoulders, and hips.
What is Miller Fisher Syndrome?
Miller Fisher syndrome is a rare, acquired nerve disease that is considered to be a variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome.
It is characterized by abnormal muscle coordination, paralysis of the eye muscles, and absence of the tendon reflexes.
Like Guillain-Barre syndrome, symptoms may be preceded by a viral illness.
Additional symptoms include generalized muscle weakness and respiratory failure.
The majority of individuals with Miller Fisher syndrome have a unique antibody that characterizes the disorder.
Who Is at Risk for a Heart Attack?
Certain risk factors make it more likely that you'll develop coronary heart disease CHD and have a heart attack.
You can control many of these risk factors.
Why does my child need these shots?

What research is being done for Cerebral Hypoxia?
The NINDS supports and conducts studies aimed at understanding neurological conditions that can damage the brain, such as cerebral hypoxia.
The goals of these studies are to find ways to prevent and treat these conditions.
What are common signs and symptoms of restless legs?
RLS symptoms may vary from day to day and in severity and frequency from person to person.
Individuals with mild RLS may have some disruption of sleep onset and minor interference in daytime activities.
In moderately severe cases, symptoms occur only once or twice a week but result in significant delay of sleep onset, with some disruption of daytime function.
In severe cases of RLS, the symptoms occur more than twice a week and result in burdensome interruption of sleep and impairment of daytime function.

Million Hearts is a national initiative to prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes in the United States by 2017.
Is BMI interpreted the same way for children and teens as it is for adults?
Although the BMI number is calculated the same way for children and adults, the criteria used to interpret the meaning of the BMI number for children and teens are different from those used for adults.
For children and teens, BMI age- and sex-specific percentiles are used for two reasons:
What Is Osteoporosis?
Osteoporosis is a condition in which the bones become less dense and more likely to fracture.
Fractures from osteoporosis can result in pain and disability.
In the United States, more than 40 million people either already have osteoporosis or are at high risk due to low bone mass.
Although postmenopausal Caucasian women have the highest risk for the disease, men and certain ethnic populations are also at risk.
What is the prognosis for Myotonia?
Myotonia is a chronic disorder.
Symptoms may improve later in life.
What is the prognosis for Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation?
Most patients experience periods of rapid deterioration lasting 1 - 2 months, with relatively stable periods in between.
The rate of progression correlates with the age at onset, meaning that children with early symptoms tend to fare more poorly.
For those with early onset, dystonia and spasticity can eventually limit the ability to walk, usually leading to use of a wheelchair by the midteens.
Life expectancy is variable, although premature death does occur in NBIA.
Premature death usually occurs secondary to dystonia and impaired swallowing, which can lead to poor nutrition or aspiration pneumonia.
With improved medical care, however, a greater number of affected individuals reach adulthood.
For those with atypcial, late-onset NBIA, many are diagnosed as adults and live well into adulthood.
How Can I Keep My Bones Healthy?
For Life-stage group 14 to 18 years old, pregnant/lactating,Calcium mg/day is 1,300, and Vitamin D IU/day is 600!

These include fever, lethargy, lack of appetite and coughing.
Some people also have reported runny nose, sore throat, eye irritation, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.
How many people have MS?
No one knows exactly how many people have MS.
Experts think there are currently 250,000 to 350,000 people in the United States diagnosed with MS.
This estimate suggests that approximately 200 new cases are diagnosed every week.
Studies of the prevalence the proportion of individuals in a population having a particular disease of MS indicate that the rate of the disease has increased steadily during the twentieth century.
Is there any treatment for Pituitary Tumors?
Generally, treatment depends on the type of tumor, the size of the tumor, whether the tumor has invaded or pressed on surrounding structures, such as the brain and visual pathways, and the individual's age and overall health.
Three types of treatment are used: surgical removal of the tumor; radiation therapy, in which high-dose x-rays are used to kill the tumor cells; and drug therapy to shrink or destroy the tumor.
Medications are also sometimes used to block the tumor from overproducing hormones.
For some people, removing the tumor will also stop the pituitary's ability to produce a specific hormone.
These individuals will have to take synthetic hormones to replace the ones their pituitary gland no longer produces.
What if NSAIDs are still needed?
Doctors and patients work together to weigh the benefits and risks of using NSAIDs, even when NSAIDs have caused an ulcer.
Patients who stop taking an NSAID at their doctor's request may want to resume use once they feel better.
In other patients, the benefits of taking an NSAID outweigh the risks.
In such cases, the doctor works with the patient to determine how an NSAID can be safely continued.

What is Stroke?
Even though a stroke occurs in the unseen reaches of the brain, the symptoms of a stroke are easy to spot.
They include sudden numbness or weakness, especially on one side of the body; sudden confusion or trouble speaking or understanding speech; sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes; sudden trouble walking, dizziness, or loss of balance or coordination; or sudden severe headache with no known cause.
All of the symptoms of stroke appear suddenly, and often there is more than one symptom at the same time.
Therefore stroke can usually be distinguished from other causes of dizziness or headache.
These symptoms may indicate that a stroke has occurred and that medical attention is needed immediately.
What is Lung cancer?

Talk with your doctor about when you'll get the test results.
What are the different types of bowel diversion surgery?
Ileoanal reservoir surgery is an option when the large intestine is removed but the anus remains intact and disease-free.
The surgeon creates a colonlike pouch, called an ileoanal reservoir, from the last several inches of the ileum.
The ileoanal reservoir is also called a pelvic pouch or J-pouch.
Stool collects in the ileoanal reservoir and then exits the body through the anus during a bowel movement.
People who have undergone ileoanal reservoir surgery initially have about six to 10 bowel movements a day.
Two or more surgeries are usually required, including a temporary ileostomy, and an adjustment period lasting several months is needed for the newly formed ileoanal reservoir to stretch and adjust to its new function.
After the adjustment period, bowel movements decrease to as few as 4 to 6 a day.
What is Complex Regional Pain Syndrome?
Complex regional pain syndrome CRPS is a chronic pain condition.
The key symptom of CRPS is continuous, intense pain out of proportion to the severity of the injury, which gets worse rather than better over time.
CRPS most often affects one of the arms, legs, hands, or feet.
Often the pain spreads to include the entire arm or leg.
Typical features include dramatic changes in the color and temperature of the skin over the affected limb or body part, accompanied by intense burning pain, skin sensitivity, sweating, and swelling.
Doctors aren't sure what causes CRPS.
In some cases the sympathetic nervous system plays an important role in sustaining the pain.
Another theory is that CRPS is caused by a triggering of the immune response, which leads to the characteristic inflammatory symptoms of redness, warmth, and swelling in the affected area.
How fit are you now?
Before you start this program, answer the How Fit and Strong Are You Now? questions.
These questions will help you determine your current level of strength and independence.
Try returning to them again, after you have been strength training for three months, six months, and twelve months.
This will help you gauge how useful the program has been to you.
Keep in mind that if you have not been able to sustain the program for any reason - say, illness or injury - your score will likely remain the same or even decrease.
Don't be discouraged - just try to get back on track.
What Are the Different Kinds of Seizures?
Doctors have described more than 30 different types of seizures.
Seizures are divided into two major categories -- focal seizures and generalized seizures.
However, there are many different types of seizures in each of these categories.
What is diverticular disease?
Diverticular disease affects the colon.
The colon is part of the large intestine that removes waste from your body.
Diverticular disease is made up of two conditions: diverticulosis and diverticulitis.
Diverticulosis occurs when pouches, called diverticula, form in the colon.
These pouches bulge out like weak spots in a tire.
Diverticulitis occurs if the pouches become inflamed.
How do I reduce your risk while visiting areas with dengue?
International travelers' risk of dengue infection can vary dependant on transmission in the area as well as exposure to mosquitoes.
You are at greater risk when an outbreak or epidemic is occurring.
If your hotel or resort does not have air conditioning or windows and doors with secure, intact screens you may be at higher risk.
You should take precautions like using repellent and killing any visible mosquitoes.
CDC recommends repellents containing DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus or IR3535 as the active ingredient.
Repellent can be applied to exposed skin and/or clothing.
Clothing impregnated with permethrin is another option pre-treated or you can treat yourself.
Some spatial repellent/insecticide products mosquito coils, plug-in or butane powered devices, may assist in reducing the risk of mosquito around you.
How is HD diagnosed?
A doctor will perform a physical exam and ask questions about your child's bowel movements.
HD is much less likely if parents can identify a time when their child's bowel habits were normal.
What Types of Exercise Are Best for People With Knee Problems?
If you already have knee problems, your doctor or physical therapist can help with a plan of exercise that will help the knees without increasing the risk of injury or further damage.
As a general rule, you should choose gentle exercises such as swimming, aquatic exercise, or walking rather than jarring exercises such as jogging or high-impact aerobics.

Adults who have the condition as a result of stroke or brain trauma can be retrained to use other clues to identify individuals.
What is the prognosis for Chiari Malformation?
Many people with Type I CM are asymptomatic and do not know they have the condition.
Many individuals with the more severe types of CM and have surgery see a reduction in their symptoms and/or prolonged periods of relative stability, although paralysis is generally permanent.
What should be done for a child having a febrile seizure?
Seizures are frightening, but it is important that parents and caregivers stay calm and carefully observe the child.
To prevent accidental injury, the child should be placed on a protected surface such as the floor or ground.
The child should not be held or restrained during a convulsion.
To prevent choking, the child should be placed on his or her side or stomach.
When possible, gently remove any objects from the child's mouth.
Never place anything in the child's mouth during a convulsion.
Objects placed in the mouth can be broken and obstruct the child's airway.
Look at your watch when the seizure starts.
If the seizure lasts 10 minutes, the child should be taken immediately to the nearest medical facility.
Once the seizure has ended, the child should be taken to his or her doctor to check for the source of the fever.
This is especially urgent if the child shows symptoms of stiff neck, extreme lethargy, or abundant vomiting.
What is A resectoscope?
A resectoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light, a lens for viewing, and a tool to remove tissue and burn away any remaining tumor cells.

What is Multiple System Atrophy?
Multiple system atrophy MSA is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by symptoms of autonomic nervous system failure such as fainting spells and bladder control problems, combined with motor control symptoms such as tremor, rigidity, and loss of muscle coordination.
MSA affects both men and women primarily in their 50s.
Although what causes MSA is unknown, the disorder's symptoms reflect the loss of nerve cells in several different areas in the brain and spinal cord that control the autonomic nervous system and coordinate muscle movements.
The loss of nerve cells may be due to the buildup of a protein called alpha-synuclein in the cells that produce dopamine, a neurotransmitter that relays motor commands in the brain.
What is The DASH eating plan?

Patients may also require physical or rehabilitative therapy to deal with muscle wasting and weakness.
Preventive treatment for those who come into sexual contact with an individual with tabes dorsalis is important.
What Genes are Linked to Parkinson's Disease?
Several genes have now been definitively linked to PD.
The first to be identified was alpha-synuclein.
In the 1990s, researchers at NIH and other institutions studied the genetic profiles of a large Italian family and three Greek families with familial PD and found that their disease was related to a mutation in this gene.
They found a second alpha-synuclein mutation in a German family with PD.
These findings prompted studies of the role of alpha-synuclein in PD, which led to the discovery that Lewy bodies abnormal masses of protein that develop inside nerve cells seen in sporadic PD contain alpha-synuclein protein.
This discovery revealed a potential link between hereditary and sporadic forms of the disease.
What Are the Signs and Symptoms of LAM?
Pleural effusions.
This condition can occur if bodily fluids collect in the space between the lung and the chest wall.
Often the fluid contains a milky substance called chyle kile.
The excess fluid in the chest may cause shortness of breath because the lung has less room to expand.
What is the prognosis for Neurosarcoidosis?
The prognosis for patients with neurosarcoidosis varies.
Approximately two-thirds of those with the condition will recover completely; the remainder will have a chronically progressing or on-and-off course of illness.
Complications resulting from immunosuppressive treatments, such as cryptococcal and tuberculous meningitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and inclusion body myositis, may be fatal for a small percentage of individuals.
When Is Revision Surgery Necessary?
Hip replacement is one of the most successful orthopaedic surgeries performed.
However, because more people are having hip replacements at a younger age, and wearing away of the joint surface becomes a problem after 15 to 20 years, replacement of an artificial joint, which is also known as revision surgery, is becoming more common.
It is more difficult than first-time hip replacement surgery, and the outcome is generally not as good, so it is important to explore all available options before having additional surgery.
How Are Thalassemias Treated?
Doctors use three standard treatments for moderate and severe forms of thalassemia.
These treatments include blood transfusions, iron chelation ke-LAY-shun therapy, and folic acid supplements.

What is Alternating Hemiplegia?
Alternating hemiplegia is a rare neurological disorder that develops in childhood, most often before the child is 18 months old.
The disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of paralysis that involve one or both sides of the body, multiple limbs, or a single limb.
The paralysis may affect different parts of the body at different times and may be brief or last for several days.
Oftentimes these episodes will resolve after sleep.
Affected children may also have abnormal movements involving stiffening or dance-like movements of a limb, as well as walking and balance problems.
Some children have seizures.
Children may have normal or delayed development.
There are both benign and more serious forms of the disorder.
Most children do not have a family history of the disorder; however, recent studies have show that some children with a family history have mutations in the genes CACNA1A, SCN1A, and ATP1A2.
Mutations in the ATP1A2 gene have previously been associated with families affect by familial hemiplegic migraine.
Who Is at Risk for a Stroke?
High blood pressure.
High blood pressure is the main risk factor for stroke.
Blood pressure is considered high if it stays at or above 140/90 mmHg over time.

The prognosis for craniosynostosis varies depending on whether single or multiple cranial sutures are involved or other abnormalities are present.
The prognosis is better for those with single suture involvement and no associated abnormalities.
What is the prognosis for Neurosyphilis?
Prognosis can change based on the type of neurosyphilis and how early in the course of the disease people with neurosyphilis get diagnosed and treated.
Individuals with asymptomatic neurosyphilis or meningeal neurosyphilis usually return to normal health.
People with meningovascular syphilis, general paresis, or tabes dorsalis usually do not return to normal health, although they may get much better.
Individuals who receive treatment many years after they have been infected have a worse prognosis.
Treatment outcome is different for every person.
How is celiac disease treated?
Some people with celiac disease show no improvement on the gluten-free diet.
The most common reason for poor response to the diet is that small amounts of gluten are still being consumed.
Hidden sources of gluten include additives such as modified food starch, preservatives, and stabilizers made with wheat.
And because many corn and rice products are produced in factories that also manufacture wheat products, they can be contaminated with wheat gluten.

Inflammation is the body's response to injury or infection.
What is Narcolepsy NAR-ko-lep-se?
Narcolepsy NAR-ko-lep-se is a disorder that causes periods of extreme daytime sleepiness.
What is malrotation?
Malrotation can prevent the cecum - the beginning of the large intestine - from moving to its normal position in the lower right area of the abdomen.
If this happens, bands of mesentery can block the small intestine, creating an intestinal obstruction - also called bowel obstruction - a life-threatening event and a medical emergency.
Malrotation may also leave the mesentery only narrowly attached to the back of the abdomen.
This incomplete attachment may result in the intestine twisting - a serious condition called volvulus - see What is volvulus?.

Investigators researching lupus seek to increase scientific understanding of the disorder and to find ways to treat, prevent, and ultimately, cure it.
Several components of the National Institutes of Health support research on lupus.
How does CO poisoning work?
Red blood cells pick up CO quicker than they pick up oxygen.
If there is a lot of CO in the air, the body may replace oxygen in blood with CO.
This blocks oxygen from getting into the body, which can damage tissues and result in death.
CO can also combine with proteins in tissues, destroying the tissues and causing injury and death.

Some basic researchers are studying the behavior of motor neurons many years after a polio attack.
Others are looking at the mechanisms of fatigue and are trying to discover the roles played by the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves, neuromuscular junction the site where a nerve cell meets the muscle cell it helps activate, and muscles.
What is Post-Polio Syndrome?
Post-polio syndrome PPS is a condition that affects polio survivors many years after recovery from an initial attack of the poliomyelitis virus.
PPS is characterized by a further weakening of muscles that were previously affected by the polio infection.
The most common symptoms include slowly progressive muscle weakness, fatigue both general and muscular, and a decrease in muscle size muscular atrophy.
Pain from joint deterioration and increasing skeletal deformities such as scoliosis are common.
Some individuals experience only minor symptoms, while others develop more visible muscle weakness and atrophy.
PPS is rarely life-threatening but the symptoms can interfere significantly with the individual's capacity to function independently.
While polio is contagious, PPS is not transmissible.
Only a polio survivor can develop PPS.

How is the safety of the 2013-2014 seasonal flu vaccine being monitored?
Two main systems being used to monitor flu vaccine safety are VAERS, which is jointly operated with FDA, and the Vaccine Safety Datalink VSD Project, managed and coordinated by CDC's Immunization Safety Office.
Other systems are also being used.
Through vaccine safety monitoring, CDC and FDA are able to quickly identify any clinically significant adverse events following immunization that warrant further study or action to protect the health of the public.
What is Central Pontine Myelinolysis?
Central pontine myelinolysis CPM is a neurological disorder that most frequently occurs after too rapid medical correction of sodium deficiency hyponatremia.
The rapid rise in sodium concentration is accompanied by the movement of small molecules and pulls water from brain cells.
Through a mechanism that is only partly understood, the shift in water and brain molecules leads to the destruction of myelin, a substance that surrounds and protects nerve fibers.
Nerve cells neurons can also be damaged.
Certain areas of the brain are particularly susceptible to myelinolysis, especially the part of the brainstem called the pons.
Some individuals will also have damage in other areas of the brain, which is called extrapontine myelinolysis EPM.
Experts estimate that 10 percent of those with CPM will also have areas of EPM.

A bone mineral density BMD test is the best way to determine your bone health.
The test can identify osteoporosis, determine your risk for fractures broken bones, and measure your response to osteoporosis treatment.
The most widely recognized BMD test is called a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, or DXA test.
It is painless - a bit like having an x-ray.
The test can measure bone density at your hip and spine.
What is the prognosis for Psychogenic Movement?
The severity of psychogenic movement symptoms and prognosis varies among individuals.
Prognosis is considered poor when the movement disorder continues for many years.
Outcome appears to be better in younger people with a shorter duration of symptoms than in older persons with more chronic symptoms.
Also, people with few and mild symptoms that have an acute onset tend to have a more favorable outcome, particularly if the duration of symptoms is relatively short and is preceded by a stressful or traumatic event.
Some individuals may continue to experience symptoms over time and develop new symptoms related to other parts of their body.

Echo also can detect increased thickness of the ventricles the heart's lower chambers.
Increased thickness may be due to high blood pressure, heart valve disease, or congenital heart defects.
How Do I Know if I Have Osteoporosis?
Since osteoporosis does not have any symptoms until a bone breaks, it is important to talk to your doctor about your bone health.
If your doctor feels that you are at risk for osteoporosis, he or she may order a bone density test.
A bone density test measures how strong - or dense - your bones are and whether you have osteoporosis.
It can also tell you what your chances are of breaking a bone.
Bone density tests are quick, safe, and painless.

What are the different types of the mucopolysaccharidoses?
MPS VII, Sly syndrome, one of the least common forms of the mucopolysaccharidoses, is estimated to occur in fewer than one in 250,000 births.
The disorder is caused by deficiency of the enzyme beta-glucuronidase.
In its rarest form, MPS VII causes children to be born with hydrops fetalis, in which extreme amounts of fluid are retained in the body.
Survival is usually a few months or less.
Most children with MPS VII are less severely affected.
Neurological symptoms may include mild to moderate mental retardation by age 3, communicating hydrocephalus, nerve entrapment, corneal clouding, and some loss of peripheral and night vision.
Other symptoms include short stature, some skeletal irregularities, joint stiffness and restricted movement, and umbilical and/or inguinal hernias.
Some patients may have repeated bouts of pneumonia during their first years of life.
Most children with MPS VII live into the teenage or young adult years.

The knowledge gained from these fundamental studies provides the foundation for understanding how to prevent or treat developmental brain defects such as schizencephaly.
What Medical Care Should a TBI Patient Receive?
Medical care usually begins when paramedics or emergency medical technicians arrive on the scene of an accident or when a TBI patient arrives at the emergency department of a hospital.
Because little can be done to reverse the initial brain damage caused by trauma, medical personnel try to stabilize the patient and focus on preventing further injury.
Primary concerns include insuring proper oxygen supply to the brain and the rest of the body, maintaining adequate blood flow, and controlling blood pressure.
Emergency medical personnel may have to open the patient's airway or perform other procedures to make sure the patient is breathing.
They may also perform CPR to help the heart pump blood to the body, and they may treat other injuries to control or stop bleeding.
Because many head-injured patients may also have spinal cord injuries, medical professionals take great care in moving and transporting the patient.
Ideally, the patient is placed on a back-board and in a neck restraint.
These devices immobilize the patient and prevent further injury to the head and spinal cord.
Who gets fecal incontinence?
Nearly 18 million U.S.
adults - about one in 12 - have fecal incontinence.
People of any age can have a bowel control problem, though fecal incontinence is more common in older adults.
Fecal incontinence is slightly more common among women.
Having any of the following can increase the risk:
Is there any treatment for Williams Syndrome?
There is no cure for Williams syndrome, nor is there a standard course of treatment.
Because WS is an uncommon and complex disorder, multidisciplinary clinics have been established at several centers in the United States .
Treatments are based on an individual's particular symptoms.
People with WS require regular cardiovascular monitoring for potential medical problems, such as symptomatic narrowing of the blood vessels, high blood pressure, and heart failure.

The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS, and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health NIH, conduct research related to neurological diseases such as lipoid proteinosis in laboratories at the NIH, and also support additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country.
Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure disorders, such as lipoid proteinosis.
What are abdominal adhesions?
Abdominal adhesions are bands of fibrous tissue that can form between abdominal tissues and organs.
Normally, internal tissues and organs have slippery surfaces, preventing them from sticking together as the body moves.
However, abdominal adhesions cause tissues and organs in the abdominal cavity to stick together.
How Are Arrhythmias Treated?
Common arrhythmia treatments include medicines, medical procedures, and surgery.
Your doctor may recommend treatment if your arrhythmia causes serious symptoms, such as dizziness, chest pain, or fainting.
What is the prognosis for Sotos Syndrome?
Sotos syndrome is not a life-threatening disorder and patients may have a normal life expectancy.
The initial abnormalities of Sotos syndrome usually resolve as the growth rate becomes normal after the first few years of life.
Developmental delays may improve in the school-age years, and adults with Sotos syndrome are likely to be within the normal range for intellect and height.
However, coordination problems may persist into adulthood.
Is there any treatment for Tourette Syndrome?
Because tic symptoms do not often cause impairment, the majority of people with TS require no medication for tic suppression.
However, effective medications are available for those whose symptoms interfere with functioning.
There is no one medication that is helpful to all people with TS, nor does any medication completely eliminate symptoms.
Effective medications are also available to treat some of the associated neurobehavioral disorders that can occur in patients with TS.

If apraxia is a symptom of another disorder, the underlying disorder should be treated.
What is Guillain-Barre Syndrome?
Guillain-Barre syndrome is a disorder in which the body's immune system attacks part of the peripheral nervous system.
The first symptoms of this disorder include varying degrees of weakness or tingling sensations in the legs.
In many instances, the weakness and abnormal sensations spread to the arms and upper body.
These symptoms can increase in intensity until the muscles cannot be used at all and the patient is almost totally paralyzed.
In these cases, the disorder is life-threatening and is considered a medical emergency.
The patient is often put on a ventilator to assist with breathing.
Most patients, however, recover from even the most severe cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome GBS, although some continue to have some degree of weakness.
Guillain-Barre syndrome is rare.
Usually Guillain-Barre occurs a few days or weeks after the patient has had symptoms of a respiratory or gastrointestinal viral infection.
Occasionally, surgery will trigger the syndrome.
In rare instances, vaccinations may increase the risk of GBS.
The disorder can develop over the course of hours or days, or it may take up to 3 to 4 weeks.
No one yet knows why Guillain-Barre strikes some people and not others or what sets the disease in motion.
What scientists do know is that the body's immune system begins to attack the body itself, causing what is known as an autoimmune disease.
Guillain-Barre is called a syndrome rather than a disease because it is not clear that a specific disease-causing agent is involved.
Reflexes such as knee jerks are usually lost.
Because the signals traveling along the nerve are slower, a nerve conduction velocity NCV test can give a doctor clues to aid the diagnosis.
The cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the spinal cord and brain contains more protein than usual, so a physician may decide to perform a spinal tap.

It is also more likely to occur in people who are overweight and in those with jobs that stress particular joints.
What is Prosopagnosia?
Prosopagnosia is a neurological disorder characterized by the inability to recognize faces.
Prosopagnosia is also known as face blindness or facial agnosia.
The term prosopagnosia comes from the Greek words for 'face' and 'lack of knowledge.' Depending upon the degree of impairment, some people with prosopagnosia may only have difficulty recognizing a familiar face; others will be unable to discriminate between unknown faces, while still others may not even be able to distinguish a face as being different from an object.
Some people with the disorder are unable to recognize their own face.
Prosopagnosia is not related to memory dysfunction, memory loss, impaired vision, or learning disabilities.
Prosopagnosia is thought to be the result of abnormalities, damage, or impairment in the right fusiform gyrus, a fold in the brain that appears to coordinate the neural systems that control facial perception and memory.
Prosopagnosia can result from stroke, traumatic brain injury, or certain neurodegenerative diseases.
In some cases it is a congenital disorder, present at birth in the absence of any brain damage.
Congenital prosopagnosia appears to run in families, which makes it likely to be the result of a genetic mutation or deletion.
Some degree of prosopagnosia is often present in children with autism and Asperger's syndrome, and may be the cause of their impaired social development.
What is Central sleep apnea?
Central sleep apnea is a less common type of sleep apnea.

It may include social skills training, cognitive behavioral therapy, medication for co-existing conditions, and other measures.
What is the upper gastrointestinal tract?
The esophagus carries food and liquids from the mouth to the stomach.
The muscular layers of the esophagus are normally pinched together at both the upper and lower ends by muscles called sphincters.
When a person swallows, the sphincters relax to let food or drink pass from the mouth into the stomach.
The muscles then close rapidly to prevent the food or drink from leaking out of the stomach back into the esophagus.
This process is automatic and people are usually not aware of it, though people sometimes feel food in their esophagus when they swallow something too large, try to eat too quickly, or drink very hot or cold liquids.
Is there any treatment for Alternating Hemiplegia?
Drug therapy including verapamil may help to reduce the severity and duration of attacks of paralysis associated with the more serious form of alternating hemiplegia.

What are the signs and symptoms of spina bifida?
Meningocele and myelomeningocele generally involve a fluid-filled sac - visible on the back - protruding from the spinal canal.
In meningocele, the sac may be covered by a thin layer of skin.
In most cases of myelomeningocele, there is no layer of skin covering the sac and an area of abnormally developed spinal cord tissue is usually exposed.
What is the prognosis for Williams Syndrome?
The prognosis for individuals with WS varies.
Some degree of mental retardation is found in most people with the disorder.
Some adults are able to function independently, complete academic or vocational school, and live in supervised homes or on their own; most live with a caregiver.
Parents can increase the likelihood that their child will be able to live semi-independently by teaching self-help skills early.
Early intervention and individualized educational programs designed with the distinct cognitive and personality profiles of WS in mind also help individuals maximize their potential.
Medical complications associated with the disorder may shorten the lifespans of some individuals with WS.
What is Thyrotoxic Myopathy?
Thyrotoxic myopathy is a neuromuscular disorder that may accompany hyperthyroidism Graves' disease, caused by overproduction of the thyroid hormone thyroxine.
Symptoms may include muscle weakness, myalgias muscle tenderness, wasting of the pelvic girdle and shoulder muscles, fatigue, and/or heat intolerance.

How is intestinal pseudo-obstruction diagnosed?
To diagnose intestinal pseudo-obstruction, a health care provider may suggest the person consult a gastroenterologist - a doctor who specializes in digestive diseases.
A health care provider will perform a physical exam; take a complete medical history, imaging studies, and a biopsy; and perform blood tests.
A health care provider may order other tests to confirm the diagnosis.
The health care provider also will look for the cause of the condition, such as an underlying illness.
What is Parkinson's Disease?
Parkinson's disease PD belongs to a group of conditions called motor system disorders, which are the result of the loss of dopamine-producing brain cells.
The four primary symptoms of PD are tremor, or trembling in hands, arms, legs, jaw, and face; rigidity, or stiffness of the limbs and trunk; bradykinesia, or slowness of movement; and postural instability, or impaired balance and coordination.
As these symptoms become more pronounced, patients may have difficulty walking, talking, or completing other simple tasks.
PD usually affects people over the age of 50.
Early symptoms of PD are subtle and occur gradually.
In some people the disease progresses more quickly than in others.
As the disease progresses, the shaking, or tremor, which affects the majority of PD patients may begin to interfere with daily activities.
Other symptoms may include depression and other emotional changes; difficulty in swallowing, chewing, and speaking; urinary problems or constipation; skin problems; and sleep disruptions.
There are currently no blood or laboratory tests that have been proven to help in diagnosing sporadic PD.
Therefore the diagnosis is based on medical history and a neurological examination.
The disease can be difficult to diagnose accurately.
Doctors may sometimes request brain scans or laboratory tests in order to rule out other diseases.
How is PSP diagnosed?
PSP is often misdiagnosed because some of its symptoms are very much like those of Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and more rare neurodegenerative disorders, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
In fact, PSP is most often misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease early in the course of the illness.
Memory problems and personality changes may also lead a physician to mistake PSP for depression, or even attribute symptoms to some form of dementia.
The key to diagnosing PSP is identifying early gait instability and difficulty moving the eyes, the hallmark of the disease, as well as ruling out other similar disorders, some of which are treatable.
What is the process for getting a liver transplant?
The process for getting a liver transplant begins with a referral by a doctor to a transplant center.
People seeking a liver transplant are carefully evaluated by a team at the transplant center to determine whether they are suitable candidates for transplantation.
The evaluation includes a complete medical history, physical examination, blood and urine tests, x rays and other imaging tests, and tests to check the function of the heart, lungs, and kidneys.
The transplant team usually includes liver transplant surgeons; liver specialists, called hepatologists; nurses; transplant coordinators; social workers; a psychiatrist; and other specialists.
A financial counselor may help with making arrangements to pay for the transplant.

What is Zellweger Syndrome?
Peroxisomes are cell structures that break down toxic substances and synthesize lipids fatty acids.
oils, and waxes that are necessary for cell function.
Peroxisomes are required for normal brain development and function and the formation of myelin, the whitish substance that coats nerve fibers.
They are also required for normal eye, liver, kidney, and bone functions.
Zellweger spectrum disorders result from dysfunctional lipid metabolism, including the over-accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids and phytanic acid, and defects of bile acids and plasmalogens--specialized lipids found in cell membranes and myelin sheaths of nerve fibers.
Symptoms of these disorders include an enlarged liver; characteristic facial features such as a high forehead, underdeveloped eyebrow ridges, and wide-set eyes; and neurological abnormalities such as mental retardation and seizures.
Infants will Zellweger syndrome also lack muscle tone, sometimes to the point of being unable to move, and may not be able to suck or swallow.
Some babies will be born with glaucoma, retinal degeneration, and impaired hearing.
Jaundice and gastrointestinal bleeding also may occur.

What is the prognosis for Hydrocephalus?
The prognosis for individuals diagnosed with hydrocephalus is difficult to predict, although there is some correlation between the specific cause of the hydrocephalus and the outcome.
Prognosis is further clouded by the presence of associated disorders, the timeliness of diagnosis, and the success of treatment.
The degree to which relief of CSF pressure following shunt surgery can minimize or reverse damage to the brain is not well understood.
Affected individuals and their families should be aware that hydrocephalus poses risks to both cognitive and physical development.
However, many children diagnosed with the disorder benefit from rehabilitation therapies and educational interventions and go on to lead normal lives with few limitations.
Treatment by an interdisciplinary team of medical professionals, rehabilitation specialists, and educational experts is critical to a positive outcome.
Left untreated, progressive hydrocephalus may be fatal.

How are NCLs inherited?
Childhood NCLs are autosomal recessive disorders; that is, they occur only when a child inherits two copies of the defective gene, one from each parent.
When both parents carry one defective gene, each of their children faces a one in four chance of developing NCL.
At the same time, each child also faces a one in two chance of inheriting just one copy of the defective gene.
Individuals who have only one defective gene are known as carriers, meaning they do not develop the disease, but they can pass the gene on to their own children.
Because the mutated genes that are involved in certain forms of Batten disease are known, carrier detection is possible in some instances.
What is Incontinentia Pigmenti?
Incontinentia pigmenti IP is an inherited disorder of skin pigmentation that is also associated with abnormalities of the teeth, skeletal system, eyes, and central nervous system.
It is one of a group of gene-linked diseases known as neurocutaneous disorders.
In most cases, IP is caused by mutations in a gene called NEMO NF-kappaB essential modulator.
Males are more severely affected than females.
Discolored skin is caused by excessive deposits of melanin normal skin pigment.
Most newborns with IP will develop discolored skin within the first two weeks.
The pigmentation involves the trunk and extremities, is slate-grey, blue or brown, and is distributed in irregular marbled or wavy lines.
The discoloration fades with age.
Neurological problems include loss of brain tissue known as cerebral atrophy, the formation of small cavities in the central white matter of the brain, and the loss of neurons in the cerebellar cortex.
About 20% of children with IP will have slow motor development, muscle weakness in one or both sides of the body, mental retardation, and seizures.
They are also likely to have visual problems, including crossed eyes, cataracts, and severe visual loss.
Dental problems are also common, including missing or peg-shaped teeth.
A related disorder, incontinentia pigmenti achromians, features skin patterns of light, unpigmented swirls and streaks that are the reverse of IP.
Associated neurological problems are similar.
What happens when the spinal cord is injured?
Traumatic spinal cord injury usually begins with a sudden, mechanical blow or rupture to the spine that fractures or dislocates vertebrae.
The damage begins at the moment of primary injury, when the cord is stretched or displaced by bone fragments or disc material.
Nerve signaling stops immediately but may not return rapidly even if there is no structural damage to the cord.
In severe injury, axons are cut or damaged beyond repair, and neural cell membranes are broken.
Blood vessels may rupture and cause bleeding into the spinal cord's central tissue, or bleeding can occur outside the cord, causing pressure by the blood clot on the cord.

Is there any treatment for Deep Brain Stimulation for Parkinson's Disease?
Unlike previous surgeries for PD, DBS involves minimal permanent surgical changes to the brain.
Instead, the procedure uses electrical stimulation to regulate electrical signals in neural circuits to and from identified areas in the brain to improve PD symptoms.
Thus, if DBS causes unwanted side effects or newer, more promising treatments develop in the future, the implantable pulse generator can be removed, and the DBS procedure can be halted.
Also, stimulation from the IPG is easily adjustable - without further surgery - if the person's condition changes.
Some people describe the pulse generator adjustments as programming..

Based on our most recent report on children who were 8-years-old and living in ADDM CP Network communities in 2008, we know that:
What are Febrile Seizures?
Febrile seizures are convulsions brought on by a fever in infants or small children.
During a febrile seizure, a child often loses consciousness and shakes.
Less commonly, a child becomes rigid or has twitches in only a portion of the body.
Most febrile seizures last a minute or two; some can be as brief as a few seconds, while others last for more than 15 minutes.
Approximately one in every 25 children will have at least one febrile seizure.
Febrile seizures usually occur in children between the ages of 6 months and 3 years and are particularly common in toddlers.
The older a child is when the first febrile seizure occurs, the less likely that child is to have more.
A few factors appear to boost a child's risk of having recurrent febrile seizures, including young age less than 15 months during the first seizures, frequent fevers, and having immediate family members with a history of febrile seizures.

A lumbar curve has its apex in the lower back.
A thoracolumbar curve has its apex where the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae join see 'Normal Spine' diagram.
What are the complications of constipation in children?
Constipation in children can lead to fecal impaction if hard stool packs the intestine and rectum so tightly that the normal pushing action of the colon is not enough to expel the stool.
The impaction should be cleared using an enema or large doses of oral laxatives for other treatments to be effective.
Constipation in children can also lead to anal fissures - small tears in the anus that may cause itching, pain, or bleeding - or rectal prolapse - a condition in which the rectum slips so that it protrudes from the anus.

Other studies are focused on understanding in detail how the disease develops, both in animal models and in patients, to better define new ways of controlling or preventing the development of the disease.
Finally, clinical trials of rapamycin are underway with NINDS and NCI support to rigorously test the potential benefit of this compound for some of the tumors that are problematic in TSC patients.
What can I do to check that animals are healthy before I bring them into a school or daycare classroom?
Ensure that personnel providing animals for educational purposes are knowledgeable regarding animal handling and zoonotic disease issues.
Persons or facilities that display animals to the public should be licensed by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture.
What is the upper gastrointestinal tract?
The esophagus carries food and liquids from the mouth to the stomach.
The muscular layers of the esophagus are normally pinched together at both the upper and lower ends by muscles called sphincters.
When a person swallows, the sphincters relax to let food or drink pass from the mouth into the stomach.
The muscles then close rapidly to prevent the food or drink from leaking out of the stomach and back into the esophagus.
This process is automatic and people are usually not aware of it, though people sometimes feel food in their esophagus when they swallow something too large, try to eat too quickly, or drink very hot or cold liquids.
What should you expect during a Chest CT Scan?
Moving your body can cause the pictures to blur.
The technician will ask you to lie still and hold your breath for short periods.
This will help make the pictures as clear as possible.
What are the symptoms?
As the disease progresses, most people will begin to develop a blurring of vision and problems controlling eye movement.
In fact, eye problems usually offer the first definitive clue that PSP is the proper diagnosis.
Individuals affected by PSP have trouble voluntarily shifting their gaze downward, and also can have trouble controlling their eyelids.
This can lead to involuntary closing of the eyes, prolonged or infrequent blinking, or difficulty in opening the eyes.
What causes iron deficiency?
Substances such as polyphenols, phytates, or calcium that are part of some foods or drinks such as tea, coffee, whole grains, legumes and milk or dairy products can decrease the amount of non-heme iron absorbed at a meal.

Tetanus is an infection caused by bacteria.
When the bacteria invade the body, they produce a toxin, or poison, that causes your muscles to tighten and cramp painfully.
Tetanus infection mainly affects the neck, chest, and stomach.
Tetanus is also called lockjaw because it often causes a person's neck and jaw muscles to lock, making it hard to open the mouth or swallow.
It can also cause breathing problems, severe muscle spasms, and seizures.
The muscle spasms can be strong enough to break your bones, and you might have to spend several weeks in the hospital under intensive care.
Complete recovery can take months.
If left untreated, tetanus can be deadly.

What are the risks of a lower gastrointestinal series?
leakage of barium into the abdomen - the area between the chest and the hips - through an undetected tear or hole in the lining of the large intestine.
This complication is rare; however, it usually requires emergency surgery to repair.
How are these disorders treated?
Currently there is no specific treatment available for most of the lipid storage disorders but highly effective enzyme replacement therapy is available for patients with type 1 Gaucher disease and some patients with type 3 Gaucher disease.
Patients with anemia may require blood transfusions.
In some patients, the enlarged spleen must be removed to improve cardiopulmonary function.
The drugs phenytoin and carbamazepine may be prescribed to help treat pain including bone pain for patients with Fabry disease.
Restricting one's diet does not prevent lipid buildup in cells and tissues.
What is Concept mapping?
Concept mapping is a tool that helps with strategic planning.
What is intestinal pseudo-obstruction?
Intestinal pseudo-obstruction is a rare condition with symptoms that resemble those caused by a blockage, or obstruction, of the intestines, also called the bowel.
However, when a health care provider examines the intestines, no blockage exists.
Instead, the symptoms are due to nerve or muscle problems that affect the movement of food, fluid, and air through the intestines.
How Can Death Due to Sudden Cardiac Arrest Be Prevented?
Ways to prevent death due to sudden cardiac arrest SCA differ depending on whether:
Is there any treatment for Familial Periodic Paralyses?
Treatment of the periodic paralyses focuses on preventing further attacks and relieving acute symptoms.
Avoiding carbohydrate-rich meals and strenuous exercise, and taking acetazolamide daily may prevent hypokalemic attacks.
Attacks can be managed by drinking a potassium chloride oral solution.
Eating carbohydrate-rich, low-potassium foods, and avoiding strenuous exercise and fasting, can help prevent hyperkalemic attacks.
Dichorphenamide may prevent attacks.
Why is childhood obesity considered a health problem?
Childhood obesity is associated with various health-related consequences.
Obese children and adolescents may experience immediate health consequences and may be at risk for weight-related health problems in adulthood.
What research is being done for Barth Syndrome?
The NINDS supports research on genetic disorders such as Barth syndrome, including basic research on mitochondrial dysfunction and investigations of other inborn errors of metabolism.
The 1996 discovery of the Barth gene is helping scientists and physicians better understand the metabolic and biochemical abnormalities seen in the disease and learn how genes cause heart disease, muscle weakness, and other problems in the body.
The ultimate goal of this research is to find ways to prevent, treat, and cure these disorders.
How Should I Use Arthritis Medicine?
Before you leave the doctor's office, make sure you ask about the best way to take the medicine the doctor prescribes.
For example, you may need to take some medicines with milk, or you may need to eat something just before or after taking them, to make sure they don't upset your stomach.
What Research is Being Done?
Parkinson's Disease Clinical Studies offer an opportunity to help researchers find better ways to safely detect, treat, or prevent PD and therefore hope for individuals now and in the future.
NINDS conducts clinical studies on Parkinson's disease at the NIH research campus in Bethesda, Maryland, and supports PD studies at medical research centers throughout the United States.
But studies can be completed only if people volunteer to participate.
By participating in a clinical study, healthy individuals and people living with Parkinson's disease can greatly benefit the lives of those affected by this disorder.
Talk with your doctor about clinical studies and help to make the difference in improving the quality of life for all people with Parkinson's disease.
For more information about NINDS clinical trials on PD, see http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=Parkinson%27s+disease+AND+NINDS.
Current studies include genetics and PD, search for PD biomarkers, experimental therapies and other treatment options, diagnostic imaging, brain control and movement disorders, DBS, and exercise and PD.
Is there any treatment for Fabry Disease?
Enzyme replacement therapy has been approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of Fabry disease.
Enzyme replacement therapy can reduce lipid storage, ease pain, and improve organ function.
The pain that accompanies the disease may be treated with anticonvulsants such as phenytoin and carbamazepine.
Gastrointestinal hyperactivity may be treated with metoclopramide.
Some individuals may require dialysis or kidney transplantation.
What is A ventilator VEN-til-a-tor?
A ventilator VEN-til-a-tor is a machine that supports breathing.
How does digestion work?
Digestion works by moving food through the GI tract.
Digestion begins in the mouth with chewing and ends in the small intestine.
As food passes through the GI tract, it mixes with digestive juices, causing large molecules of food to break down into smaller molecules.
The body then absorbs these smaller molecules through the walls of the small intestine into the bloodstream, which delivers them to the rest of the body.
Waste products of digestion pass through the large intestine and out of the body as a solid matter called stool.
What is The CT scan?
The CT scan is a noninvasive x ray that produces three-dimensional pictures of parts of the body.
What Is Inflammatory Bowel Disease?
Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are also known as inflammatory bowel diseases.
Crohn's disease tends to affect the small intestine, although any part of the digestive tract may be involved.
Ulcerative colitis usually causes an inflammation in all or part of the large intestine.
People with inflammatory bowel disease IBD often have diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, and weight loss.
What is the prognosis for Herpes Zoster Oticus?
Generally, the prognosis of herpes zoster oticus is good.
However, in some cases, hearing loss may be permanent.
Vertigo may last for days or weeks.
Facial paralysis may be temporary or permanent.
What is the prognosis for Complex?
The outcome of CRPS varies from person to person.
Almost all children and teenagers have good recovery.
Occasionally individuals are left with unremitting pain and crippling, irreversible changes despite treatment.
Anecdotal evidence suggests early treatment, particularly rehabilitation, is helpful in limiting the disorder, but this benefit has not yet been proven in clinical studies.
More research is needed to understand the causes of CRPS, how it progresses, and the role of early treatment.
Higher functioning children with prenatal alcohol exposure: Is there a specific neurocognitive profile?
Child Neuropsychology: A Journal on Normal and Abnormal Development in Childhood and Adolescence; 2013; 196:561-578
How serious is this infection in dogs?
The number of dogs infected with this disease that die is very small.
Some dogs have asymptomatic infections no symptoms, while some have severe infections.
Severe illness is characterized by the onset of pneumonia.
Although this is a relatively new cause of disease in dogs and nearly all dogs are susceptible to infection, about 80 percent of dogs will have a mild form of disease.
What is Atherosclerosis?
Atherosclerosis is a disease in which plaque builds up inside the arteries.
What Is Sarcoidosis?
These cells release chemicals that recruit other cells to isolate and destroy the harmful substance.
Inflammation occurs during this process.
Once the harmful substance is gone, the cells and the inflammation go away.
What is Chemotherapy?
Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing.
Who can get this vaccine?
Fluzone High-Dose is approved for use in people 65 years of age and older.
As with all flu vaccines, Fluzone High-Dose is not recommended for people who have had a severe reaction to the flu vaccine in the past.
What Does Sleep Do For Us?
Deep sleep coincides with the release of growth hormone in children and young adults.
Many of the body's cells also show increased production and reduced breakdown of proteins during deep sleep.
Since proteins are the building blocks needed for cell growth and for repair of damage from factors like stress and ultraviolet rays, deep sleep may truly be beauty sleep.
Activity in parts of the brain that control emotions, decision-making processes, and social interactions is drastically reduced during deep sleep, suggesting that this type of sleep may help people maintain optimal emotional and social functioning while they are awake.
A study in rats also showed that certain nerve-signaling patterns which the rats generated during the day were repeated during deep sleep.
This pattern repetition may help encode memories and improve learning.
How are gallstones treated?
If gallstones are not causing symptoms, treatment is usually not needed.
However, if a person has a gallbladder attack or other symptoms, a health care provider will usually recommend treatment.
A person may be referred to a gastroenterologist - a doctor who specializes in digestive diseases - for treatment.
If a person has had one gallbladder attack, more episodes will likely follow.
What causes gastritis?
Helicobacter pylori H.
pylori infection causes most cases of chronic nonerosive gastritis.
H.
pylori are bacteria that infect the stomach lining.
H.
pylori are primarily transmitted from person to person.
In areas with poor sanitation, H.
pylori may be transmitted through contaminated food or water.
What is the prognosis for Rasmussen's Encephalitis?
The prognosis for individuals with Rasmussen's encephalitis varies.
Despite the advances in medical treatment, none has yet been shown to halt the progress of the disease in the long term.
The disorder may lead to severe neurological deficits or it may cause only milder impairments.
For some children, surgery decreases seizures.
However, most individuals with Rasmussen's encephalitis are left with some paralysis, cognitive deficits, and problems with speech.
In some cases, the disease can progress to involve the opposite brain hemisphere.
What are the benefits of antiviral drugs?
When used for treatment, antiviral drugs can lessen symptoms and shorten the time you are sick by 1 or 2 days.
They also can prevent serious flu complications, like pneumonia.
For people with a high risk medical condition, treatment with an antiviral drug can mean the difference between having milder illness instead of very serious illness that could result in a hospital stay.
How Are Pleurisy and Other Pleural Disorders Treated?
Pleurisy and other pleural disorders are treated with procedures, medicines, and other methods.

What is Schwannomatosis?
Schwannomatosis is a rare form of neurofibromatosis that is genetically and clinically distinct from NF1 and NF2.
Who Is Eligible for a Heart Transplant?
In general, patients selected for heart transplants have severe end-stage heart failure, but are healthy enough to have the transplant.
Heart failure is considered 'end stage' when all possible treatments - such as medicines, implanted devices, and surgery - have failed.
What should you expect before Carotid Endarterectomy?
Your doctor will tell you how to prepare for carotid endarterectomy CEA.
Before CEA, you may have one or more tests to examine your carotid arteries.
These tests can show whether your arteries are narrowed and how much they're narrowed.
Who is more likely to develop an inguinal hernia?
People of any age can develop inguinal hernias.
Indirect hernias can appear before age 1 and often appear before age 30; however, they may appear later in life.
Premature infants have a higher chance of developing an indirect inguinal hernia.
Direct hernias, which usually only occur in male adults, are much more common in men older than age 40 because the muscles of the abdominal wall weaken with age.
What Is Pneumonia?
Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs that can cause mild to severe illness in people of all ages.
Common signs of pneumonia can include cough, fever, and difficulty breathing.
Certain people are more likely to become ill with pneumonia.
What causes these diseases?
Symptoms of Batten disease and other NCLs are linked to a buildup of substances called lipofuscins lipopigments in the body's tissues.
These lipopigments are made up of fats and proteins.
Their name comes from the technical word lipo, which is short for lipid or fat, and from the term pigment, used because they take on a greenish-yellow color when viewed under an ultraviolet light microscope.
The lipopigments build up in cells of the brain and the eye as well as in skin, muscle, and many other tissues.
The substances are found inside a part of cells called lysosomes.
Lysosomes are responsible for getting rid of things that become damaged or are no longer needed and must be cleared from inside the cell.
The accumulated lipopigments in Batten disease and the other NCLs form distinctive shapes that can be seen under an electron microscope.
Some look like half-moons, others like fingerprints.
These deposits are what doctors look for when they examine a skin sample to diagnose Batten disease.
The specific appearance of the lipopigment deposits can be useful in guiding further diagnostic tests that may identify the specific gene defect.
What is Bone marrow?
Bone marrow is the spongy tissue inside the large bones of your body.
When should a child with constipation see a health care provider?
A child should see a health care provider if symptoms of constipation last for more than 2 weeks.
A child should see a health care provider sooner if the child has constipation and one or more of the following symptoms that may indicate a more serious health problem:
What Are the Risks of Using an Automated External Defibrillator?
Automated external defibrillators AEDs are safe to use.
There are no reports of AEDs harming bystanders or users.
Also, there are no reports of AEDs delivering inappropriate shocks.
What research is being done for Transverse?
The NINDS also funds researchers who are using animal models of spinal cord injury to study strategies for replacement or regeneration of spinal cord nerve cells.
The ultimate goals of these studies are to encourage the same regeneration in humans and to restore function to paralyzed patients.
Scientists are also developing neural prostheses to help patients with spinal cord damage compensate for lost function.
These sophisticated electrical and mechanical devices connect with the nervous system to supplement or replace lost motor and sensory function.
Neural prostheses for spinal cord injured patients are being tested in humans.
What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Immune Thrombocytopenia?
Immune thrombocytopenia ITP may not cause any signs or symptoms.
However, ITP can cause bleeding inside the body internal bleeding or underneath or from the skin external bleeding.
Signs of bleeding may include:
What is the prognosis for Arachnoid Cysts?
Untreated, arachnoid cysts may cause permanent severe neurological damage when progressive expansion of the cysts or bleeding into the cyst injures the brain or spinal cord.
Symptoms usually resolve or improve with treatment.
What is the prognosis for Agnosia?
Agnosia can compromise quality of life.
What is Arthrodesis?
Arthrodesis is a surgical procedure that involves removing the joint and fusing the bones into one immobile unit, often using bone grafts from the person's own pelvis.
Is Shingles Contagious?
Shingles cannot be passed from one person to another.
However, a person with shingles can transmit VZV to others.
If a person who has never had chickenpox gets infected with VZV, he or she will develop chickenpox, not shingles.
What is A heart biopsy?
A heart biopsy is a standard test that can show whether your body is rejecting the new heart.
How is porphyria treated?
Treatment for porphyria depends on the type of porphyria the person has and the severity of the symptoms.
What is Tetralogy of Fallot?
Tetralogy of Fallot is a rare, complex heart defect.
What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Hemolytic Anemia?
People who have mild hemolytic anemia often have no signs or symptoms.
More severe hemolytic anemia may cause many signs and symptoms, and they may be serious.
What are the symptoms of peripheral nerve damage?
Sensory nerve damage causes a more complex range of symptoms because sensory nerves have a wider, more highly specialized range of functions.
Larger sensory fibers enclosed in myelin a fatty protein that coats and insulates many nerves register vibration, light touch, and position sense.
Damage to large sensory fibers lessens the ability to feel vibrations and touch, resulting in a general sense of numbness, especially in the hands and feet.
People may feel as if they are wearing gloves and stockings even when they are not.
Many patients cannot recognize by touch alone the shapes of small objects or distinguish between different shapes.
This damage to sensory fibers may contribute to the loss of reflexes as can motor nerve damage.
Loss of position sense often makes people unable to coordinate complex movements like walking or fastening buttons, or to maintain their balance when their eyes are shut.
Neuropathic pain is difficult to control and can seriously affect emotional well-being and overall quality of life.
Neuropathic pain is often worse at night, seriously disrupting sleep and adding to the emotional burden of sensory nerve damage.
Why can't some victims identify stroke symptoms?
Because stroke injures the brain, one is not able to perceive one's own problems correctly.
To a bystander, the stroke patient may seem unaware or confused.
A stroke victim's best chance is if someone around her recognizes the stroke and acts quickly.
How Is Childhood Interstitial Lung Disease Diagnosed?
Doctors diagnose childhood interstitial lung disease chILD based on a child's medical and family histories and the results from tests and procedures.
To diagnose chILD, doctors may first need to rule out other diseases as the cause of a child's symptoms.
Am I at high risk for complications from the flu?
For some people, the flu is more likely to cause serious illness that can lead to hospitalization or even death.
If you are at high risk from the flu, it's especially important to get the vaccine before flu begins to spread in your community.
What is Monoclonal antibodytherapy?
Monoclonal antibodytherapy is a type of targeted therapy that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell.
What is Treatment Surgery?
Treatment Surgery is the treatment of choice for patients with localized melanoma.
What can a person expect after a liver biopsy?
Liver biopsy results take a few days to come back.
The liver sample goes to a pathology lab where a technician stains the tissue.
Staining highlights important details within the liver tissue and helps identify any signs of liver disease.
The pathologist - a doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseases - looks at the tissue with a microscope and sends a report to the person's health care provider.
What are the symptoms of Crohn's disease?
bleeding in the rectum, which can be seen in a person's underwear, in the toilet, or in a bowel movement; rectal bleeding can be serious and may not stop without medical help.
How Is Osteoporosis Diagnosed?
A bone mineral density test is the best way to check your bone health.
This test can:
What causes diarrhea?
Sometimes no cause can be found.
As long as diarrhea goes away within 1 to 2 days, finding the cause is not usually necessary.
What should you expect before Bronchoscopy?
You'll be given medicine before the procedure to help you relax.
The medicine will make you sleepy, so you should arrange for a ride home after the procedure.
What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Bronchiectasis?
The initial airway damage that leads to bronchiectasis often begins in childhood.
However, signs and symptoms may not appear until months or even years after you start having repeated lung infections.
What Special Risks do Women Face?
In the same way that the hormonal changes during pregnancy and childbirth are associated with increased risk of stroke, hormonal changes at the end of the childbearing years can increase the risk of stroke.
Several studies have shown that menopause, the end of a woman's reproductive ability marked by the termination of her menstrual cycle, can increase a woman's risk of stroke.
Fortunately, some studies have suggested that hormone replacement therapy can reduce some of the effects of menopause and decrease stroke risk.
Currently, the NINDS is sponsoring the Women's Estrogen for Stroke Trial WEST, a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, to determine whether estrogen therapy can reduce the risk of death or recurrent stroke in postmenopausal women who have a history of a recent TIA or non-disabling stroke.
The mechanism by which estrogen can prove beneficial to postmenopausal women could include its role in cholesterol control.
Studies have shown that estrogen acts to increase levels of HDL while decreasing LDL levels.
How is SMA diagnosed in children?
A blood test is available that can indicate whether there are deletions or mutations of the SMN1 gene.
This test identifies at least 95 percent of SMA Types I, II, and III.
Other diagnostic tests may include electrodiagnosis with nerve conduction velocities EMG, and muscle biopsy.
What is Quitting smoking?
Quitting smoking is the most important step you can take to treat COPD.
What is Frontotemporal Dementia ?
Frontotemporal dementia FTD describes a clinical syndrome associated with shrinking of the frontal and temporal anterior lobes of the brain.
Originally known as Pick's disease, the name and classification of FTD has been a topic of discussion for over a century.
The current designation of the syndrome groups together Pick's disease, primary progressive aphasia, and semantic dementia as FTD.
Some doctors propose adding corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy to FTD and calling the group Pick Complex.
These designations will continue to be debated.
As it is defined today, the symptoms of FTD fall into two clinical patterns that involve either 1 changes in behavior, or 2 problems with language.
The first type features behavior that can be either impulsive disinhibited or bored and listless apathetic and includes inappropriate social behavior; lack of social tact; lack of empathy; distractability; loss of insight into the behaviors of oneself and others; an increased interest in sex; changes in food preferences; agitation or, conversely, blunted emotions; neglect of personal hygiene; repetitive or compulsive behavior, and decreased energy and motivation.
The second type primarily features symptoms of language disturbance, including difficulty making or understanding speech, often in conjunction with the behavioral type's symptoms.
Spatial skills and memory remain intact.
There is a strong genetic component to the disease; FTD often runs in families.
Why is surgery performed?
The Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy vs.
Stenting Trial CREST compared carotid endarterectomy surgery to carotid artery stenting and found no significance between the procedures regarding the 4-year rate of stroke or death in patients with or without a previous stroke.
The pivotal differences were the lower rate of stroke following surgery and the lower rate of heart attack following stenting.
The study also found that the age of the patient made a difference with a larger benefit for stenting, the younger the age of the patient.
At age 69 and younger, stenting results were slightly better.
Conversely, for patients older than 70, surgical benefits were slightly superior to stenting, with larger benefit for surgery, the older the patient.
What Causes Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis?
Repeatedly breathing in foreign substances can cause hypersensitivity pneumonitis HP.
Examples of these substances include molds, dusts, and chemicals.
Mold often is the cause of HP.
These substances also are known as antigens.
How Can Osteoporosis Be Prevented?
Engage in a regular regimen of weight-bearing exercises in which bones and muscles work against gravity.
This might include walking, jogging, racquet sports, climbing stairs, team sports, weight training, and using resistance machines.
A doctor should evaluate the exercise program of anyone already diagnosed with osteoporosis to determine if twisting motions and impact activities, such as those used in golf, tennis, or basketball, need to be curtailed.
How do kids get lead poisoning?
Paint in homes built before 1978 often has lead in it.
When old paint cracks and chips, it creates lead dust.
Children get lead poisoning from breathing in the dust or swallowing it from their hands and toys.
How is it diagnosed?
The comprehensive evaluation includes neurologic and genetic assessment, with in-depth cognitive and language testing to establish IQ and evaluate psychomotor function, verbal and non-verbal strengths and weaknesses, style of learning, and independent living skills.
An assessment of communication strengths and weaknesses includes evaluating non-verbal forms of communication gaze and gestures; the use of non-literal language metaphor, irony, absurdities, and humor; patterns of inflection, stress and volume modulation; pragmatics turn-taking and sensitivity to verbal cues; and the content, clarity, and coherence of conversation.
The physician will look at the testing results and combine them with the child's developmental history and current symptoms to make a diagnosis.
What is Neuromyelitis Optica ?
Historically, NMO was diagnosed in patients who experienced a rapid onset of blindness in one or both eyes, followed within days or weeks by varying degrees of paralysis in the arms and legs.
In most cases, however, the interval between optic neuritis and transverse myelitis is significantly longer, sometimes as long as several years.
After the initial attack, NMO follows an unpredictable course.
Most individuals with the syndrome experience clusters of attacks months or years apart, followed by partial recovery during periods of remission.
This relapsing form of NMO primarily affects women.
The female to male ratio is greater than 4:1.
Another form of NMO, in which an individual only has a single, severe attack extending over a month or two, is most likely a distinct disease that affects men and women with equal frequency.
The onset of NMO varies from childhood to adulthood, with two peaks, one in childhood and the other in adults in their 40s.
How do people getSalmonella infections from reptiles and amphibians?
Reptiles and amphibians might have Salmonella germs on their bodies even when they appear healthy and clean.
The germs can also get on cages, aquariums, terrariums, the water reptiles and amphibians live or swim in, and other containers that house them.
Anything that reptiles and amphibians touch should be considered possibly contaminated with Salmonella.
When you touch reptiles and amphibians, the germs can get on your hands or clothing.
It is important to wash your hands immediately after touching animals, or anything in the area where they live and roam, including water from containers or aquariums, because the germs on your hands can easily spread to other people or things.
What is Angiography?
Angiography is a dye test used to analyze the arteries or veins.
How do I stay connected?
See if there is a testing site near you to get tested for hepatitis B or C by entering in your zip code on our Hepatitis Testing Day Event page.
What is Menetrier's disease?
In a normal stomach, mucous cells in the rugae release protein-containing mucus.
The mucous cells in enlarged rugae release too much mucus, causing proteins to leak from the blood into the stomach.
This shortage of protein in the blood is known as hypoproteinemia.
Menetrier's disease also reduces the number of acid-producing cells in the stomach, which decreases stomach acid.
What is Chemotherapy?
Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing.
What Causes Paget's Disease?
However, genes alone are unlikely to cause the disorder.
Though it has not been proven definitively, many doctors believe that something in the environment contributes to the development of Paget's disease in people who are genetically predisposed.
Some scientists are studying the possibility that a slow-acting virus may cause Paget's disease.
What is gastritis?
Gastritis is a condition in which the stomach lining - known as the mucosa - is inflamed.
The stomach lining contains special cells that produce acid and enzymes, which help break down food for digestion, and mucus, which protects the stomach lining from acid.
When the stomach lining is inflamed, it produces less acid, enzymes, and mucus.
How do I protect and improve well water quality?
The Private Well Class: Free Online Training for Homeowners with Water Wells.
What is chronic hepatitis B?
Hepatitis B becomes chronic when the body's immune system can't get rid of the virus.
Over time, having the virus can lead to inflammation of the liver; scar tissue in the liver, called cirrhosis; or liver cancer.
Inflammation is the painful red swelling that results when tissues of the body become infected.
Young children and people with weakened immune systems are especially at risk.
People who were infected as infants have a 90 percent chance of developing chronic hepatitis B.
How is Friedreich's ataxia diagnosed?
A diagnosis of Friedreich's ataxia requires a careful clinical examination, which includes a medical history and a thorough physical exam, in particular looking for balance difficulty, loss of proprioception joint sensation, absence of reflexes, and signs of neurological problems.
Genetic testing now provides a conclusive diagnosis.
Other tests that may aid in the diagnosis or management of the disorder include:
Will the seasonal flu vaccine protect me against a flu pandemic?
If there is a flu pandemic, it's important to get the pandemic vaccine once it's available.
It can take time to make new vaccines to protect people from a pandemic flu virus.
What is Dilated cardiomyopathy?
Dilated cardiomyopathy is the most common type of the disease.
What should I do if I think I have Chagas disease?
You should discuss your concerns with your health care provider, who will examine you and ask you questions for example, about your health and where you have lived.
Chagas disease is diagnosed by blood tests.
If you are found to have Chagas disease, you should have a heart tracing test electrocardiogram, even if you feel fine.
You might be referred to a specialist for more tests and for treatment.
How Can Vasculitis Be Prevented?
People who have severe vasculitis are treated with prescription medicines.
Rarely, surgery may be done.
People who have mild vasculitis may find relief with over-the-counter pain medicines, such as acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen.
How can abdominal adhesions be prevented?
Laparoscopic surgery decreases the potential for abdominal adhesions because several tiny incisions are made in the lower abdomen instead of one large incision.
The surgeon inserts a laparoscope - a thin tube with a tiny video camera attached - into one of the small incisions.
The camera sends a magnified image from inside the body to a video monitor.
Patients will usually receive general anesthesia during this surgery.
What are the risk factors?
Low birthweight and premature birth.
Premature babies born less than 37 weeks into pregnancy and babies weighing less than 5 pounds at birth have a much higher risk of developing cerebral palsy than full-term, heavier weight babies.
Tiny babies born at very early gestational ages are especially at risk.
What research is being done for Autism?
The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS conducts research in its laboratories at the National Institutes of Health NIH and also supports additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country.
As part of the Children's Health Act of 2000, the NINDS and three sister institutes have formed the NIH Autism Coordinating Committee to expand, intensify, and coordinate NIH's autism research.
As part of the Children's Health Act of 2000, the NINDS and three sister institutes have formed the NIH Autism Coordinating Committee to expand, intensify, and coordinate NIH's autism research.
Eight dedicated research centers across the country have been established as 'Centers of Excellence in Autism Research' to bring together researchers and the resources they need.
The Centers are conducting basic and clinical research, including investigations into causes, diagnosis, early detection, prevention, and treatment of autism.
Why is it important to monitor highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses?
HPAI H5N1 influenza viruses, like all influenza A viruses, are constantly changing.
Since they were first detected in humans in 1997, H5N1 influenza viruses have evolved into different genetic groups or 'clades.' Some genetic changes may help H5N1 viruses become more transmissible - or more capable of spreading and causing serious illness in humans and animals.
When novel influenza viruses become more transmissible in humans and there is little to no immunity to them in the human population, an influenza pandemic may occur.
Other genetic changes may cause H5N1 viruses to become resistant to antiviral drugs.
CDC and other health organizations around the world closely monitor genetic changes that could have implications for animal and public health.
What is Sickle cell anemia?
Sickle cell anemia is an inherited disease.
Is there any treatment for Meningitis and Encephalitis?
Antiviral medications may be prescribed for herpes encephalitis or other severe viral infections.
Antibiotics may be prescribed for bacterial infections.
Anticonvulsants are used to prevent or treat seizures.
Corticosteroids are used to reduce brain swelling and inflammation.
Sedatives may be needed for irritability or restlessness.
Over-the-counter medications may be used for fever and headache.
Individuals with encephalitis or bacterial meningitis are usually hospitalized for treatment.
How is cyclic vomiting syndrome treated?
Well phase treatment.
During the well phase, a health care provider may use medications to treat people whose episodes are frequent and long lasting in an effort to prevent or ease future episodes.
A person may need to take a medication daily for 1 to 2 months before evaluating whether it helps prevent episodes.
A health care provider may prescribe the following medications for both children and adults during the well phase to prevent cyclic vomiting syndrome episodes, lessen their severity, and reduce their frequency: amitriptyline Elavil.
What research is being done for Psychogenic Movement?
Scientists at NIH's National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke are investigating risk factors and neurobiological markers of psychogenic movement disorders also called functional or stress-related movement disorders.
A number of biological and psychosocial factors may act together to bring on uncontrollable movements such as twitching, jerking, twisting or weakness of certain body parts.
The study examines several genetic markers which are involved in stress and emotional disorders.
It also assesses cortisol levels and heart rate variability as a measure of stress and autonomic nervous system functioning, and detailed psychological measures.
Highly advanced brain imaging will detect changes in structures of the brain and the strength of fiber connections between certain brain areas.
Findings in patients with psychogenic movement disorders will be compared to those of healthy volunteers.
How is UC treated?
Treatment for UC depends on the severity of the disease and its symptoms.
Each person experiences UC differently, so treatment is adjusted for each individual.
How is an upper gastrointestinal series performed?
An x-ray technician and a radiologist - a doctor who specializes in medical imaging - perform an upper GI series at a hospital or an outpatient center.
A person does not need anesthesia.
The procedure usually takes about 2 hours to complete.
However, if the barium moves slowly through the small intestine, the test may take up to 5 hours to complete.
What is the prognosis for Sleep Apnea?
Untreated, sleep apnea can be life threatening.
Excessive daytime sleepiness can cause people to fall asleep at inappropriate times, such as while driving.
Sleep apnea also appears to put individuals at risk for stroke and transient ischemic attacks TIAs, also known as 'mini-strokes', and is associated with coronary heart disease, heart failure, irregular heartbeat, heart attack, and high blood pressure.
Although there is no cure for sleep apnea, recent studies show that successful treatment can reduce the risk of heart and blood pressure problems.
How Is High Blood Pressure Diagnosed?
High blood pressure HBP is diagnosed using a blood pressure test.
This test will be done several times to make sure the results are correct.
If your numbers are high, your doctor may have you return for repeat tests to check your blood pressure over time.
What Is Pulmonary Rehabilitation?

What is Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome?
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a severe form of epilepsy.
Seizures usually begin before 4 years of age.
Seizure types, which vary among patients, include tonic stiffening of the body, upward deviation of the eyes, dilation of the pupils, and altered respiratory patterns, atonic brief loss of muscle tone and consciousness, causing abrupt falls, atypical absence staring spells, and myoclonic sudden muscle jerks.
There may be periods of frequent seizures mixed with brief, relatively seizure-free periods.
Most children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome experience some degree of impaired intellectual functioning or information processing, along with developmental delays, and behavioral disturbances.
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome can be caused by brain malformations, perinatal asphyxia, severe head injury, central nervous system infection and inherited degenerative or metabolic conditions.
In 30-35 percent of cases, no cause can be found.

The sooner you start, the better your chances of preventing or delaying the condition.
How Is Rheumatoid Arthritis Diagnosed?
Rheumatoid arthritis can be difficult to diagnose in its early stages for several reasons.
First, there is no single test for the disease.
In addition, symptoms differ from person to person and can be more severe in some people than in others.
Also, symptoms can be similar to those of other types of arthritis and joint conditions, and it may take some time for other conditions to be ruled out.
Finally, the full range of symptoms develops over time, and only a few symptoms may be present in the early stages.
As a result, doctors use a variety of the following tools to diagnose the disease and to rule out other conditions:

Are there treatments for SMA?
Breathing issues: Babies with SMA especially those with Type I may need help breathing, especially at night, using non-invasive methods that include negative pressure ventilators and bi-level positive airway pressure support, which direct air through the nostrils via a small, gently-fitted mask.
Children who survive their first two years are at risk for complications involving the lungs, which may not be fully developed.
A regular program of respiratory therapy and breathing exercises is helpful.
Parents should be instructed in chest physiotherapy CPT, a series of physical maneuvers that clear the lungs and airway.
What are the problems of Crohn's disease?
Ulcers from Crohn's disease can cause tunnels to form through the inflamed areas, or even the healthy parts, of the intestine.
These tunnels are called fistulas.
Fistulas are seen most often in the areas around the rectum and anus.
Sometimes a pocket of infection, called an abscess, can form in and around the fistulas.
Most fistulas can be treated with medicines, but sometimes surgery is needed.

What is Empty Sella Syndrome?
Empty Sella Syndrome ESS is a disorder that involves the sella turcica, a bony structure at the base of the brain that surrounds and protects the pituitary gland.
ESS is a condition that is often discovered during tests for pituitary disorders, when radiological imaging of the pituitary gland reveals a sella turcica that appears to be empty.
There are two types of ESS: primary and secondary.
Primary ESS happens when a small anatomical defect above the pituitary gland increases pressure in the sella turcica and causes the gland to flatten out along the interior walls of the sella turcica cavity.
Primary ESS is associated with obesity and high blood pressure in women.
The disorder sometimes results in a build-up of fluid pressure inside the skull and the pituitary gland may be smaller than usual.
Secondary ESS is the result of the pituitary gland regressing within the cavity after an injury, surgery, or radiation therapy.
Individuals with secondary ESS due to destruction of the pituitary gland have symptoms that reflect the loss of pituitary functions, such as the ceasing of menstrual periods, infertility, fatigue, and intolerance to stress and infection.
In children, ESS may be associated with early onset of puberty, growth hormone deficiency, pituitary tumors, or pituitary gland dysfunction.
MRI scans are useful in evaluating ESS and differentiating it from other disorders that produce an enlarged sella.
Is there any treatment for Inclusion Body Myositis?
There is no cure for IBM, nor is there a standard course of treatment.

How long is a person with flu virus contagious?
The period when an infected person is contagious depends on the age and health of the person.
Studies show that most healthy adults may be able to infect others from 1 day prior to becoming sick and for 5 days after they first develop symptoms.
Some young children with weakened immune systems may be contagious for longer than a week.
What is diarrhea?
Diarrhea of any duration may cause dehydration, which means the body lacks enough fluid and electrolytes - chemicals in salts, including sodium, potassium, and chloride - to function properly.
Loose stools contain more fluid and electrolytes and weigh more than solid stools.

How is gastroparesis treated if a person has diabetes?
An elevated blood glucose level directly interferes with normal stomach emptying, so good blood glucose control in people with diabetes is important.
However, gastroparesis can make blood glucose control difficult.
When food that has been delayed in the stomach finally enters the small intestine and is absorbed, blood glucose levels rise.
Gastric emptying is unpredictable with gastroparesis, causing a person's blood glucose levels to be erratic and difficult to control.
Is there any treatment for Developmental Dyspraxia?
Treatment is symptomatic and supportive and may include occupational and speech therapy, and cueing or other forms of communication such as using pictures and hand gestures.
Many children with the disorder require special education.
How is a virtual colonoscopy performed?
For the test, the person will lie on a table while the radiologist inserts a thin tube through the anus and into the rectum.
The tube inflates the large intestine with air for a better view.
The table slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the radiologist takes the x ray images.
The radiologist may ask the person to hold his or her breath several times during the test to steady the images.
The radiologist will ask the person to turn over on the side or stomach so the radiologist can take different images of the large intestine.
The procedure lasts about 10 to 15 minutes.

What is Troyer Syndrome?
Troyer syndrome is one of more than 40 genetically-distinct neurological disorders known collectively as the hereditary spastic paraplegias.
These disorders are characterized by their paramount feature of progressive muscle weakness and spasticity in the legs.
Additional symptoms of Troyer syndrome also called SPG20 include leg contractures, difficulty walking, speech disorders, drooling, atrophy of the hand muscles, developmental delays, fluctuating emotions, and short stature.
Onset is typically in early childhood, and symptoms gradually worsen over time.
Troyer syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder meaning that both parents must carry and pass on the defective gene that produces the illness that results from a mutation in the spastic paraplegia gene SPGP20 located in chromosome 13 that results in loss of the spartin proteins.
The disease was first observed in Amish families in Ohio.
Diagnosis is made by specialized genetic testing.
What is A healthy diet?
A healthy diet is an important part of a healthy lifestyle.
What is Tethered Spinal Cord Syndrome?
Tethered spinal cord syndrome is a neurological disorder caused by tissue attachments that limit the movement of the spinal cord within the spinal column.
Attachments may occur congenitally at the base of the spinal cord conus medullaris or they may develop near the site of an injury to the spinal cord.
These attachments cause an abnormal stretching of the spinal cord.
The course of the disorder is progressive.
In children, symptoms may include lesions, hairy patches, dimples, or fatty tumors on the lower back; foot and spinal deformities; weakness in the legs; low back pain; scoliosis; and incontinence.
This type of tethered spinal cord syndrome appears to be the result of improper growth of the neural tube during fetal development, and is closely linked to spina bifida.
Tethered spinal cord syndrome may go undiagnosed until adulthood, when pain, sensory and motor problems, and loss of bowel and bladder control emerge.
This delayed presentation of symptoms is related to the degree of strain placed on the spinal cord over time and may be exacerbated during sports or pregnancy, or may be due to narrowing of the spinal column stenosis with age.
Tethering may also develop after spinal cord injury and scar tissue can block the flow of fluids around the spinal cord.
Fluid pressure may cause cysts to form in the spinal cord, a condition called syringomyelia.
This can lead to additional loss of movement, feeling or the onset of pain or autonomic symptoms.
What Is Cholesterol?
Your body needs some cholesterol to make hormones, vitamin D, and substances that help you digest foods.
Your body makes all the cholesterol it needs.
However, cholesterol also is found in some of the foods you eat.
What are Brain and Spinal Tumors?
Brain and spinal cord tumors are abnormal growths of tissue found inside the skull or the bony spinal column, which are the primary components of the central nervous system CNS.
Benign tumors are noncancerous, and malignant tumors are cancerous.
The CNS is housed within rigid, bony quarters i.e., the skull and spinal column, so any abnormal growth, whether benign or malignant, can place pressure on sensitive tissues and impair function.
Tumors that originate in the brain or spinal cord are called primary tumors.
Most primary tumors are caused by out-of-control growth among cells that surround and support neurons.
In a small number of individuals, primary tumors may result from specific genetic disease e.g., neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis or from exposure to radiation or cancer-causing chemicals.
The cause of most primary tumors remains a mystery.
They are not contagious and, at this time, not preventable.
Symptoms of brain tumors include headaches, seizures, nausea and vomiting, vision or hearing problems, behavioral and cognitive problems, motor problems, and balance problems.
Spinal cord tumor symptoms include pain, sensory changes, and motor problems.
The first test to diagnose brain and spinal column tumors is a neurological examination.
Special imaging techniques computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography are also employed.
Laboratory tests include the EEG and the spinal tap.
A biopsy, a surgical procedure in which a sample of tissue is taken from a suspected tumor, helps doctors diagnose the type of tumor.

The knowledge gained from these studies provides the foundation for understanding abnormal development and offers hope for new ways to treat and prevent NMDs.
What disorders are associated with TS?
Many individuals with TS experience additional neurobehavioral problems that often cause more impairment than the tics themselves.
These include inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity attention deficit hyperactivity disorder - ADHD; problems with reading, writing, and arithmetic; and obsessive-compulsive symptoms such as intrusive thoughts/worries and repetitive behaviors.
For example, worries about dirt and germs may be associated with repetitive hand-washing, and concerns about bad things happening may be associated with ritualistic behaviors such as counting, repeating, or ordering and arranging.
People with TS have also reported problems with depression or anxiety disorders, as well as other difficulties with living, that may or may not be directly related to TS.
In addition, although most individuals with TS experience a significant decline in motor and vocal tics in late adolescence and early adulthood, the associated neurobehavioral conditions may persist.
Given the range of potential complications, people with TS are best served by receiving medical care that provides a comprehensive treatment plan.
What Is Polycythemia Vera?
Thicker blood also doesn't flow as quickly to your body as normal blood.

Opsoclonus myoclonus is a rare neurological disorder characterized by an unsteady, trembling gait, myoclonus brief, shock-like muscle spasms, and opsoclonus irregular, rapid eye movements.
Other symptoms may include difficulty speaking, poorly articulated speech, or an inability to speak.
A decrease in muscle tone, lethargy, irritability, and malaise a vague feeling of bodily discomfort may also be present.
Opsoclonus myoclonus may occur in association with tumors or viral infections.
It is often seen in children with tumors.
What is the long-term outlook for those with Guillain-Barre syndrome?
Guillain-Barre syndrome can be a devastating disorder because of its sudden and unexpected onset.
In addition, recovery is not necessarily quick.
As noted above, patients usually reach the point of greatest weakness or paralysis days or weeks after the first symptoms occur.
Symptoms then stabilize at this level for a period of days, weeks, or, sometimes, months.
The recovery period may be as little as a few weeks or as long as a few years.
About 30 percent of those with Guillain-Barre still have a residual weakness after 3 years.
About 3 percent may suffer a relapse of muscle weakness and tingling sensations many years after the initial attack.
What is Constipation caused by?
Constipation is caused by stool spending too much time in your colon.
Is there any treatment for Aphasia?
In some instances, an individual will completely recover from aphasia without treatment.
In most cases, however, language therapy should begin as soon as possible and be tailored to the individual needs of the patient.
Rehabilitation with a speech pathologist involves extensive exercises in which patients read, write, follow directions, and repeat what they hear.
Computer-aided therapy may supplement standard language therapy.

What are Neurological Complications of AIDS?
AIDS is primarily an immune system disorder caused by the human immunodeficiency virus HIV, but it can also affect the nervous system.
HIV does not appear to directly invade nerve cells but it jeopardizes their health and function, causing symptoms such as confusion, forgetfulness, behavioral changes, headaches, progressive weakness and loss of sensation in the arms and legs, cognitive motor impairment, or damage to the peripheral nerves.
Other complications that can occur as a result of HIV infection or the drugs used to treat it include pain, seizures, shingles, spinal cord problems, lack of coordination, difficult or painful swallowing, anxiety disorder, depression, fever, vision loss, gait disorders, destruction of brain tissue, and coma.
Other AIDS-related nervous system disorders may be caused by certain cancers or by illnesses that would not otherwise affect people with healthy immune systems.
How is diarrhea treated?
Taking medicine to stop diarrhea can be helpful in some cases.
Medicines you can buy over the counter without a prescription include loperamide Imodium and bismuth subsalicylate Pepto-Bismol, Kaopectate.
Stop taking these medicines if symptoms get worse or if the diarrhea lasts more than 2 days.
If you have bloody diarrhea, you should not use over-the-counter diarrhea medicines.
These medicines may make diarrhea last longer.
The health care provider will usually prescribe antibiotics instead.
What is Status epilepticus?
Status epilepticus is a potentially life-threatening condition in which a person either has an abnormally prolonged seizure or does not fully regain consciousness between recurring seizures.
Is there any treatment for Von?
Treatment for VHL varies according to the location and size of the tumor and its associated cyst.
In general, the objective of treatment is to treat the growths when they are causing symptoms but while they are still small so that they do not cause permanent problems by putting pressure on the brain or spine, blocking the flow of cerebrospinal fluid in the nervous system, or impairing vision.
Treatment of most cases of VHL usually involves surgery to remove the tumors before they become harmful.
Certain tumors can be treated with focused high-dose irradiation.
Individuals with VHL need careful monitoring by a physician and/or medical team familiar with the disorder.
What research is being done for Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation?
The NINDS supports research on neurodegenerative movement disorders such as NBIA.

Most children with GERD who are younger than 12 do not have heartburn.
Other common GERD symptoms include.
What are the symptoms of gastroparesis?
Symptoms may be aggravated by eating greasy or rich foods, large quantities of foods with fiber - such as raw fruits and vegetables - or drinking beverages high in fat or carbonation.
Symptoms may be mild or severe, and they can occur frequently in some people and less often in others.
The symptoms of gastroparesis may also vary in intensity over time in the same individual.
Sometimes gastroparesis is difficult to diagnose because people experience a range of symptoms similar to those of other diseases.
Is there any treatment for Antiphospholipid Syndrome?
The main goal of treatment is to thin the blood to reduce clotting.
At present, the recommended treatment is low-dose aspirin.
For individuals who have already had a stroke or experience recurrent clots, doctors recommend treatment with the anticoagulant warfarin.
Pregnant women are treated with either aspirin or another anticoagulant -- heparin -- since warfarin can cause birth defects.
What is Heart failure?
Heart failure is a condition in which your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs.

How is tremor diagnosed?
During a physical exam a doctor can determine whether the tremor occurs primarily during action or at rest.
The doctor will also check for tremor symmetry, any sensory loss, weakness or muscle atrophy, or decreased reflexes.
A detailed family history may indicate if the tremor is inherited.
Blood or urine tests can detect thyroid malfunction, other metabolic causes, and abnormal levels of certain chemicals that can cause tremor.
These tests may also help to identify contributing causes, such as drug interaction, chronic alcoholism, or another condition or disease.
Diagnostic imaging using computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging may help determine if the tremor is the result of a structural defect or degeneration of the brain.
What are the symptoms of transverse myelitis?
Transverse myelitis may be either acute developing over hours to several days or subacute usually developing over 1 to 4 weeks.
Initial symptoms usually include localized lower back pain, sudden paresthesias abnormal sensations such as burning, tickling, pricking, or tingling in the legs, sensory loss, and paraparesis partial paralysis of the legs.
Paraparesis may progress to paraplegia paralysis of the legs and lower part of the trunk.
Urinary bladder and bowel dysfunction is common.
Many patients also report experiencing muscle spasms, a general feeling of discomfort, headache, fever, and loss of appetite.
Depending on which segment of the spinal cord is involved, some patients may experience respiratory problems as well.
What is A concussion?
A concussion is a brain injury caused by a bump or blow to the head that can change the way your brain normally works.
How Do Doctors Diagnose Heritable Disorders of Connective Tissue?
Diagnosis always rests first on a combination of family history, medical history, and physical examination.
Because many of these conditions are uncommon, the family physician may suspect a diagnosis but be uncertain about how to confirm it.
At this point, referral to experienced clinicians, often medical geneticists, can be extremely valuable to either confirm or exclude the suspected diagnosis.
Laboratory tests are available to confirm the diagnosis for many heritable disorders of connective tissue, but not for all.
Once a diagnosis is made, laboratory studies may be available to provide some or all of the following:
What other problems can damage my new liver?
Recurrence of the disease that caused the need for a transplant can damage a new liver.
For example, the hepatitis C virus may return and damage the new liver in a patient who had hepatitis C before the transplant.

A flu vaccine is still the first and best way to prevent influenza.
What are some common signs or symptoms?
Unlike the severe withdrawal from the rest of the world that is characteristic of autism, children with Asperger syndrome are isolated because of their poor social skills and narrow interests.
Children with the disorder will gather enormous amounts of factual information about their favorite subject and will talk incessantly about it, but the conversation may seem like a random collection of facts or statistics, with no point or conclusion.
They may approach other people, but make normal conversation difficult by eccentric behaviors or by wanting only to talk about their singular interest.
Who gets diverticulosis and diverticular disease?
Diverticulosis becomes more common as people age, particularly in people older than age 50.
Some people with diverticulosis develop diverticulitis, and the number of cases is increasing.
Although diverticular disease is generally thought to be a condition found in older adults, it is becoming more common in people younger than age 50, most of whom are male.
Can Hepatitis C be spread through sexual contact?
Yes, but the risk of transmission from sexual contact is believed to be low.
The risk increases for those who have multiple sex partners, have a sexually transmitted disease, engage in rough sex, or are infected with HIV.
More research is needed to better understand how and when Hepatitis C can be spread through sexual contact.
What is ulcerative colitis?
Normally, the large intestine absorbs water from stool and changes it from a liquid to a solid.
In UC, the inflammation causes loss of the lining of the colon, leading to bleeding, production of pus, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort.
What is Treatment based on?
Treatment is based on the type of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm the patient has.
What causes Wilson disease?
Wilson disease is caused by an inherited autosomal recessive mutation, or change, in the ATP7B gene.
In an autosomal recessive disease, the child has to inherit the gene mutation from both parents to have an increased likelihood for the disease.
The chance of a child inheriting autosomal recessive mutations from both parents with a gene mutation is 25 percent, or one in four.
If only one parent carries the mutated gene, the child will not get the disease, although the child may inherit one copy of the gene mutation.
The child is called a 'carrier' of the disease and can pass the gene mutation to the next generation.
Genetic testing is a procedure that identifies changes in a patient's genes and can show whether a parent or child is a carrier of a mutated gene.
Autosomal recessive diseases are typically not seen in every generation of an affected family.
What do the numbers tell us?
Across the United States, the average level of support that birth facilities provide to mothers and babies as they get started with breastfeeding is inadequate, and hospital practices and policies that interfere with breastfeeding remain common.
In the United States, too few hospitals participate in the global program to recognize best practices in supporting breastfeeding mothers and babies, known as the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative.
How Can Heart Valve Disease Be Prevented?
Let your doctors and dentists know if you have a man-made valve or if you've had IE before.

What is Inclusion Body Myositis?
Inclusion body myositis IBM is one of a group of muscle diseases known as the inflammatory myopathies, which are characterized by chronic, progressive muscle inflammation accompanied by muscle weakness.
The onset of muscle weakness in IBM is generally gradual over months or years and affects both proximal close to the trunk of the body and distal further away from the trunk muscles.
Muscle weakness may affect only one side of the body.
Falling and tripping are usually the first noticeable symptoms of IBM.
For some individuals, the disorder begins with weakness in the wrists and fingers that causes difficulty with pinching, buttoning, and gripping objects.
There may be weakness of the wrist and finger muscles and atrophy thinning or loss of muscle bulk of the forearm muscles and quadricep muscles in the legs.
Difficulty swallowing occurs in approximately half of IBM cases.
Symptoms of the disease usually begin after the age of 50, although the disease can occur earlier.
IBM occurs more frequently in men than in women.

Why Are Car Crashes a Risk for Travelers?
More and more people are driving cars and riding motorcycles in developing countries, and these countries are an increasingly common destination for US tourists.
Roads in these countries may be poorly maintained, and traffic laws may be haphazardly followed or enforced.
A crash in a developing country is more likely to be fatal because emergency care may not be readily available.
It may take a long time to get to a center that can provide appropriate care, and care, where available, may not be up to US standards.
How can you and your loved ones safeguard against surgical site infections?
Follow your doctor's instructions for cleaning your skin before your surgery.

How are liver donors and potential recipients matched?
Livers for transplantation are identified and allocated through policies developed by the OPTN.
The UNOS maintains a centralized computer network that links all organ procurement organizations and transplant centers in the United States.
Livers are allocated to specific recipients based on the status 1 and MELD and PELD scoring systems, which give priority to people with the most urgent need for a new liver.
Donors and recipients are matched on the basis of having compatible blood types and ideally should be similar in size.
Can cerebral palsy be prevented?
Cerebral palsy related to genetic abnormalities cannot be prevented, but a few of the risk factors for congenital cerebral palsy can be managed or avoided.
For example, rubella, or German measles, is preventable if women are vaccinated against the disease before becoming pregnant.
Rh incompatibilities can also be managed early in pregnancy.
Acquired cerebral palsy, often due to head injury, is often preventable using common safety tactics, such as using car seats for infants and toddlers.
What is the prognosis for Lipoid Proteinosis?
Lipoid proteinosis has a stable or slowly progressive course.

Q.
Can people get influenza from eating pork?
A.
Flu viruses in pigs have not been shown to be transmissible to people through eating properly handled and prepared pork pig meat or other products derived from pigs.
For more information about the proper handling and preparation of pork, visit the USDA website fact sheet Fresh Pork from Farm to Table.
What is Adrenoleukodystrophy?
X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy ALD is one of a group of genetic disorders called the leukodystrophies that cause damage to the myelin sheath, an insulating membrane that surrounds nerve cells in the brain.
Women have two X chromosomes and are the carriers of the disease, but since men only have one X chromosome and lack the protective effect of the extra X chromosome, they are more severely affected.
People with X-ALD accumulate high levels of saturated, very long chain fatty acids VLCFA in the brain and adrenal cortex.
The loss of myelin and the progressive dysfunction of the adrenal gland are the primary characteristics of X-ALD.
While nearly all patients with X-ALD suffer from adrenal insufficiency, also known as Addison's disease, the neurological symptoms can begin either in childhood or in adulthood.
The childhood cerebral form is the most severe, with onset between ages 4 and 10.
The most common symptoms are usually behavioral changes such as abnormal withdrawal or aggression, poor memory, and poor school performance.
Other symptoms include visual loss, learning disabilities, seizures, poorly articulated speech, difficulty swallowing, deafness, disturbances of gait and coordination, fatigue, intermittent vomiting, increased skin pigmentation, and progressive dementia.
The milder adult-onset form is also known as adrenomyeloneuropathy AMN, which typically begins between ages 21 and 35.
Symptoms may include progressive stiffness, weakness or paralysis of the lower limbs, and ataxia.
Although adult-onset ALD progresses more slowly than the classic childhood form, it can also result in deterioration of brain function.
Almost half the women who are carriers of X-ALS will develop a milder form of AMN but almost never will develop symptoms seen in boys the X-ALD.
X-ALD should not be confused with neonatal adrenoleukodsystrophy, which is a disease of newborns and young infants and belongs to the group of peroxisomal biogenesis disorders.
What is Crohn's disease?
Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease that causes irritation in the GI tract.
How is NF2 treated?
NF2 is best managed at a specialty clinic with an initial screening and annual follow-up evaluations more frequent if the disease is severe.
Improved diagnostic technologies, such as magnetic resonance imaging MRI, can reveal tumors of the vestibular nerve as small as a few millimeters in diameter.
Vestibular schwannomas grow slowly, but they can grow large enough to engulf one of the eighth cranial nerves and cause brain stem compression and damage to surrounding cranial nerves.
Surgical options depend on tumor size and the extent of hearing loss.
There is no general agreement among doctors about when surgery should be performed or which surgical option is best.
Individuals considering surgery should carefully weigh the risks and benefits of all options to determine which treatment is right for them.
Surgery to remove the entire tumor while it's still small might help preserve hearing.
If hearing is lost during this surgery, but the auditory nerve is maintained, the surgical placement of a cochlear implant a device placed in the inner ear, or cochlea, that processes electronic signals from sound waves to the auditory nerve may be an option to improve hearing.
As tumors grow larger, it becomes harder to surgically preserve hearing and the auditory nerve.
The development of the penetrating auditory brain stem implant a device that stimulates the hearing portions of the brain can restore some hearing in individuals who have completely lost hearing and do not have an auditory nerve present.
Surgery for other tumors associated with NF2 is aimed at controlling or relieving symptoms.
Surgery also can correct cataracts and retinal abnormalities.
How Can I Help Research?

How do molds get in the indoor environment and how do they grow?
When mold spores drop on places where there is excessive moisture, such as where leakage may have occurred in roofs, pipes, walls, plant pots, or where there has been flooding, they will grow.
Many building materials provide suitable nutrients that encourage mold to grow.
Wet cellulose materials, including paper and paper products, cardboard, ceiling tiles, wood, and wood products, are particularly conducive for the growth of some molds.
Other materials such as dust, paints, wallpaper, insulation materials, drywall, carpet, fabric, and upholstery, commonly support mold growth.
What should you expect during Heart Surgery?
Heart surgery is done in a hospital, and a team of experts is involved.
Cardiothoracic surgeons perform the surgery with other doctors and nurses who help.
What is Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis?
Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis SSPE is a progressive neurological disorder of children and young adults that affects the central nervous system CNS.
It is a slow, but persistent, viral infection caused by defective measles virus.
SSPE has been reported from all parts of the world, but it is considered a rare disease in developed countries, with fewer than 10 cases per year reported in the United States.
The incidence of SSPE declined by at least 90 percent in countries that have practiced widespread immunization with measles vaccine.
The incidence of SSPE is still high in developing countries such as India and Eastern Europe.
There is a higher incidence among males than females male/female: 3/1.
Most youngsters with SSPE have a history of measles infection at an early age, usually younger than 2 years, followed by a latent period of 6 to 8 years before neurological symptoms begin.
Despite the long interval between the measles infection and the onset of SSPE, researchers think that the infection of the brain occurs soon after the primary bout with measles and progresses slowly.
Why it persists and progresses still isn't clear.
The initial symptoms of SSPE are subtle and include mild mental deterioration such as memory loss and changes in behavior such as irritability followed by disturbances in motor function, including uncontrollable involuntary jerking movements of the head, trunk or limbs called myoclonic jerks.
Seizures may also occur.
Some people may become blind.
In advanced stages of the disease, individuals may lose the ability to walk, as their muscles stiffen or spasm.
There is progressive deterioration to a comatose state, and then to a persistent vegetative state.
Death is usually the result of fever, heart failure, or the brain's inability to continue controlling the autonomic nervous system.
What should you expect during a Lung Ventilation/Perfusion Scan?
For the test, you lie on a table for about 1 hour and have two types of scans: ventilation and perfusion.
The ventilation scan shows the pattern of air flow in your lungs.
The perfusion scan shows the pattern of blood flow in your lungs.
What is Chemotherapy?
Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
How is viral gastroenteritis diagnosed?
Viral gastroenteritis is usually diagnosed based on symptoms alone.
People who have symptoms that are severe or last for more than a few days may want to see a health care provider for additional tests.
A health care provider may ask for a stool sample to test for rotavirus or norovirus or to rule out bacteria or parasites as the cause of the gastroenteritis.
What is the prognosis for Hydrocephalus?
The prognosis for individuals diagnosed with hydrocephalus is difficult to predict, although there is some correlation between the specific cause of hydrocephalus and the patient's outcome.
Prognosis is further complicated by the presence of associated disorders, the timeliness of diagnosis, and the success of treatment.
The symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus usually get worse over time if the condition is not treated, although some people may experience temporary improvements.
If left untreated, progressive hydrocephalus is fatal, with rare exceptions.
The parents of children with hydrocephalus should be aware that hydrocephalus poses risks to both cognitive and physical development.
Treatment by an interdisciplinary team of medical professionals, rehabilitation specialists, and educational experts is critical to a positive outcome.
Many children diagnosed with the disorder benefit from rehabilitation therapies and educational interventions, and go on to lead normal lives with few limitations.
How can you tell the difference between a cold and the flu?
Because colds and flu share many symptoms, it can be difficult or even impossible to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone.
Special tests that usually must be done within the first few days of illness can be carried out, when needed to tell if a person has the flu.
How Are Pleurisy and Other Pleural Disorders Diagnosed?

The condition may worsen or expand to surrounding muscles; remain the same for many years; and, in rare cases, improve spontaneously.
Is there any treatment for Alzheimer's Disease?
Currently there are no medicines that can slow the progression of AD.
However, four FDA-approved medications are used to treat AD symptoms.
These drugs help individuals carry out the activities of daily living by maintaining thinking, memory, or speaking skills.
They can also help with some of the behavioral and personality changes associated with AD.
However, they will not stop or reverse AD and appear to help individuals for only a few months to a few years.
Donepezil Aricept, rivastigmine Exelon, and galantamine Razadyne are prescribed to treat mild to moderate AD symptoms.
Donepezil was recently approved to treat severe AD as well.
The newest AD medication is memantine Namenda, which is prescribed to treat moderate to severe AD symptoms.
What are the complications of diverticulitis and how are they treated?
These complications need to be treated to prevent them from getting worse and causing serious illness.
In some cases, surgery may be needed.
What Is Osteoporosis?
Osteoporosis often can be prevented.
It is known as a 'silent disease' because, if undetected, bone loss can progress for many years without symptoms until a fracture occurs.
Osteoporosis has been called a childhood disease with old age consequences because building healthy bones in youth helps prevent osteoporosis and fractures later in life.
However, it is never too late to adopt new habits for healthy bones.
How common is acute Hepatitis C in the United States?
In 2009, there were an estimated 16,000 acute Hepatitis C virus infections reported in the United States.

Ashkenazi Jews are people who are descended from the Jewish population of Eastern Europe.
Afrikaners are White natives of South Africa who speak a language called Afrikaans.
This ethnic group is descended from early Dutch, French, and German settlers.
What is Moyamoya Disease?
Moyamoya disease is a rare, progressive cerebrovascular disorder caused by blocked arteries at the base of the brain in an area called the basal ganglia.
The name 'moyamoya' means 'puff of smoke' in Japanese and describes the look of the tangle of tiny vessels formed to compensate for the blockage.
Moyamoya disease was first described in Japan in the 1960's and it has since been found in individuals in the United States , Europe , Australia , and Africa .
The disease primarily affects children, but it can also occur in adults.
In children, the first symptom of Moyamoya disease is often stroke, or recurrent transient ischemic attacks TIA, commonly referred to as 'mini-strokes', frequently accompanied by muscular weakness or paralysis affecting one side of the body, or seizures.
Adults most often experience a hemorrhagic stroke due to recurring blood clots in the affected brain vessels.
Individuals with this disorder may have disturbed consciousness, speech deficits usually aphasia, sensory and cognitive impairments, involuntary movements, and vision problems.
Because it tends to run in families, researchers think that Moyamoya disease is the result of inherited genetic abnormalities.
Studies that look for the abnormal genes may help reveal the biomechanisms that cause the disorder.
Q: How many types of HPV are there?
A: There are more than 40 HPV types that can infect the genital areas of males and females.

What is Mohs micrographic surgery?
Mohs micrographic surgery is a specialized technique used to achieve the narrowest margins necessary to avoid tumor recurrence, while maximally preserving cosmesis.
How is Machado-Joseph Disease diagnosed?
Physicians diagnose MJD by recognizing the symptoms of the disease and by taking a family history.
They ask detailed questions about family members who show or showed symptoms of the disease, the kinds of symptoms seen in these relatives, the ages of disease onset, and the progression and severity of symptoms.
A definitive diagnosis of MJD can be made only with a genetic test.
The genetic test for MJD SCA3 is highly accurate.
Those individuals who are at risk for MJD i.e.
have an affected parent but do not have any symptoms can undergo presymptomatic testing to determine whether they carry the disease allele and thus will later develop the disease.
Obtaining presymptomatic testing is a highly personal decision that at-risk individuals should make only after fully considering the potential pros and cons.
Many at-risk persons choose not to undergo this test out of concern for job discrimination and difficulty in obtaining or maintaining insurance, among other reasons.
For more information on genetic testing and counseling, please consult the organizations listed in the section titled 'Where can I get more information?'.

How Is Asthma Diagnosed?
Your doctor also will figure out the severity of your asthma - that is, whether it's intermittent, mild, moderate, or severe.
The treatment your doctor prescribes will depend on the level of severity.
What else is important to know about the intradermal vaccine?
The intradermal flu vaccine uses a very fine needle that is 90% smaller than the needles used for regular flu shots.
This may be helpful for people who don't like needles.
Another feature of the intradermal vaccine is that it requires 40% less antigen than the regular flu shot.
This is useful because the same amount of available antigen can be used to make more doses of the vaccine.
What should you expect before Cardiac Catheterization?

To understand this test, it helps to understand how the heart works.
How Is Heart Valve Disease Treated?
Currently, no medicines can cure heart valve disease.
However, lifestyle changes and medicines often can successfully treat symptoms and delay problems for many years.
Eventually, though, you may need surgery to repair or replace a faulty heart valve.
How Can Coronary Heart Disease Be Prevented or Delayed?
A healthy diet includes a variety of vegetables and fruits.
It also includes whole grains, fat-free or low-fat dairy products, and protein foods, such as lean meats, poultry without skin, seafood, processed soy products, nuts, seeds, and beans and peas.
How Is Respiratory Failure Treated?
Acute respiratory failure can be a medical emergency.
It often is treated in an intensive care unit at a hospital.
Chronic respiratory failure often can be treated at home.
If chronic respiratory failure is severe, your doctor may recommend treatment in a long-term care center.
How is autoimmune hepatitis diagnosed?
A health care provider performs a physical exam and reviews the person's health history, including the use of alcohol and medications that can harm the liver.
A person usually needs blood tests for an exact diagnosis because a person with autoimmune hepatitis can have the same symptoms as those of other liver diseases or metabolic disorders.

But good tooth care can prevent tooth decay.
What are Neurological Sequelae Of Lupus?
Lupus also called systemic lupus erythematosus is a disorder of the immune system.
Normally, the immune system protects the body against invading infections and cancers.
In lupus, the immune system is over-active and produces increased amounts of abnormal antibodies that attack the body's tissues and organs.
Lupus can affect many parts of the body, including the joints, skin, kidneys, lungs, heart, nervous system, and blood vessels.
The signs and symptoms of lupus differ from person to person; the disease can range from mild to life threatening.
What is ANENCEPHALY?
ANENCEPHALY is a neural tube defect that occurs when the cephalic head end of the neural tube fails to close, usually between the 23rd and 26th days of pregnancy, resulting in the absence of a major portion of the brain, skull, and scalp.
What research is being done on the neurofibromatoses?
In the mid-1990s, research supported by the NINDS located the exact position of the NF1 gene on chromosome 17.
The gene has been cloned and its structure continues to be analyzed.
The NF1 gene makes a large and complex protein called neurofibromin, which is primarily active in nervous system cells as a regulator of cell division and functions as a kind of molecular brake to keep cells from over-multiplying.
In addition to work on NF1, intensive efforts have led to the identification of the NF2 gene on chromosome 22.
As in NF1, the NF2 gene product is a tumor-suppressor protein called merlin or schwannomin.
What is Farber's Disease?
Farber's disease describes a group of inherited metabolic disorders called lipid storage diseases, in which excess amounts of lipids oils, fatty acids, and related compounds build up to harmful levels in the joints, tissues, and central nervous system.
The liver, heart, and kidneys may also be affected.
Symptoms are typically seen in the first few weeks of life and include impaired motor and mental ability and difficulty with swallowing.
Other symptoms may include arthritis, swollen lymph nodes and joints, hoarseness, nodules under the skin and sometimes in the lungs and other parts of the body, chronic shortening of muscles or tendons around joints, and vomiting.
Affected persons may require the insertion of a breathing tube.
In severe cases, the liver and spleen are enlarged.
Farber's disease is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme ceramidase.
The disease occurs when both parents carry and pass on the defective gene that regulates the protein sphingomyelin.
Children born to these parents have a 25 percent chance of inheriting the disorder and a 50 percent chance of carrying the faulty gene.
The disorder affects both males and females.
What is Megalencephaly?
Megalencephaly, also called macrencephaly, is a condition in which an infant or child has an abnormally large, heavy, and usually malfunctioning brain.
By definition, the brain weight is greater than average for the age and gender of the child.
Head enlargement may be evident at birth or the head may become abnormally large in the early years of life.
Megalencephaly is thought to be related to a disturbance in the regulation of cell production in the brain.
In normal development, neuron proliferation - the process in which nerve cells divide to form new generations of cells - is regulated so that the correct number of cells is produced in the proper place at the appropriate time.
In a megalencephalic brain, too many cells are produced either during development or progressively as part of another disorder, such as one of the neurofibromatoses or leukodystrophies.
Symptoms of megalencephaly include delayed development, seizures, and corticospinal brain cortex and spinal cord dysfunction.
Megalencephaly affects males more often than females.
Unilateral megalencephaly or hemimegalencephaly is a rare condition that is characterized by the enlargement of one side of the brain.
Children with this disorder may have a large, asymmetrical head accompanied by seizures, partial paralysis, and mental retardation.
Megalencephaly is different from macrocephaly also called megacephaly or megalocephaly, which describes a big head, and which doesn't necessarily indicate abnormality.
Large head size is passed down through the generations in some families.
Who gets myasthenia gravis?
Rarely, children may show signs of congenital myasthenia or congenital myasthenic syndrome.
These are not autoimmune disorders, but are caused by defective genes that produce abnormal proteins instead of those which normally would produce acetylcholine, acetylcholinesterase the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine, or the acetylcholine receptor and other proteins present along the muscle membrane.
What is Chagas disease?
The impact of Chagas disease is not limited to the rural areas in Latin America in which vectorborne transmission occurs.
Large-scale population movements from rural to urban areas of Latin America and to other regions of the world have increased the geographic distribution and changed the epidemiology of Chagas disease.
In the United States and in other regions where Chagas disease is now found but is not endemic, control strategies should focus on preventing transmission from blood transfusion, organ transplantation, and mother-to-baby congenital transmission.

What are the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome?
Symptoms usually start gradually, with frequent burning, tingling, or itching numbness in the palm of the hand and the fingers, especially the thumb and the index and middle fingers.
Some carpal tunnel sufferers say their fingers feel useless and swollen, even though little or no swelling is apparent.
The symptoms often first appear in one or both hands during the night, since many people sleep with flexed wrists.
A person with carpal tunnel syndrome may wake up feeling the need to shake out the hand or wrist.
As symptoms worsen, people might feel tingling during the day.
Decreased grip strength may make it difficult to form a fist, grasp small objects, or perform other manual tasks.
In chronic and/or untreated cases, the muscles at the base of the thumb may waste away.
Some people are unable to tell between hot and cold by touch.
What research is being done for Parkinson's Disease?
The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS conducts PD research in laboratories at the National Institutes of Health NIH and also supports additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country.
Current research programs funded by the NINDS are using animal models to study how the disease progresses and to develop new drug therapies.
Scientists looking for the cause of PD continue to search for possible environmental factors, such as toxins, that may trigger the disorder, and study genetic factors to determine how defective genes play a role.
Other scientists are working to develop new protective drugs that can delay, prevent, or reverse the disease.
Is there any treatment for Stiff-Person Syndrome?
People with SPS respond to high doses of diazepam and several anti-convulsants, gabapentin and tiagabine.

What Kind of Research Is Being Done?
One major focus of research in recent years has been on the relative efficacy and cost effectiveness of surgical versus nonsurgical treatment of conditions associated with low back and leg pain.
A multi-year multicenter study called the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial SPORT compared the most commonly used standard surgical and nonsurgical treatments for patients with the three most common diagnoses for which spine surgery is performed: intervertebral disk herniation, spinal stenosis, and degenerative spondylisthesis.
Key findings included the following:
What is an exacerbation or attack of MS?
When the symptoms of the attack subside, an individual with MS is said to be in remission.
However, MRI data have shown that this is somewhat misleading because MS lesions continue to appear during these remission periods.
Patients do not experience symptoms during remission because the inflammation may not be severe or it may occur in areas of the brain that do not produce obvious symptoms.
Research suggests that only about 1 out of every 10 MS lesions is perceived by a person with MS.
Therefore, MRI examination plays a very important role in establishing an MS diagnosis, deciding when the disease should be treated, and determining whether treatments work effectively or not.
It also has been a valuable tool to test whether an experimental new therapy is effective at reducing exacerbations.
Who Is at Risk for Asthma?
Young children who often wheeze and have respiratory infections - as well as certain other risk factors - are at highest risk of developing asthma that continues beyond 6 years of age.
The other risk factors include having allergies, eczema an allergic skin condition, or parents who have asthma.
Who Is at Risk for Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia?
Some people who have PCD have breathing problems from the moment of birth.
However, other people can go through all or most of their lives without knowing that they have the disease.
What are the Major Effects of the Disease?
In some individuals, the disease may begin with uncontrolled movements in the fingers, feet, face, or trunk.
These movements - which are signs of chorea - often intensify when the person is anxious.
HD can also begin with mild clumsiness or problems with balance.
Some people develop choreic movements later, after the disease has progressed.
They may stumble or appear uncoordinated.
Chorea often creates serious problems with walking, increasing the likelihood of falls.

How is a colonoscopy performed?
For the test, the person will lie on a table while the gastroenterologist inserts a colonoscope into the anus and slowly guides it through the rectum and into the colon.
The scope inflates the large intestine with air to give the gastroenterologist a better view.
The camera sends a video image of the intestinal lining to a computer screen, allowing the gastroenterologist to carefully examine the intestinal tissues.
The gastroenterologist may move the person several times so the scope can be adjusted for better viewing.
Once the scope has reached the opening to the small intestine, the gastroenterologist slowly withdraws it and examines the lining of the large intestine again.
What should you expect during Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator Surgery?
Once the wires are in place, your doctor will make a small cut into the skin of your chest or abdomen.
He or she will then slip the ICD's small metal box through the cut and just under your skin.

What types of birth control help prevent STDs?
Non-barrier methods, like birth control pills and intrauterine devices IUDs, don't prevent STDs.
If you choose one of these methods, you will still need male latex condoms to help prevent HIV and other STDs.
Are there other MD-like conditions?
There are many other heritable diseases that affect the muscles, the nerves, or the neuromuscular junction.
Such diseases as inflammatory myopathy, progressive muscle weakness, and cardiomyopathy heart muscle weakness that interferes with pumping ability may produce symptoms that are very similar to those found in some forms of MD, but they are caused by different genetic defects.
The differential diagnosis for people with similar symptoms includes congenital myopathy, spinal muscular atrophy, and congenital myasthenic syndromes.
The sharing of symptoms among multiple neuromuscular diseases, and the prevalence of sporadic cases in families not previously affected by MD, often makes it difficult for people with MD to obtain a quick diagnosis.
Gene testing can provide a definitive diagnosis for many types of MD, but not all genes have been discovered that are responsible for some types of MD.
Some individuals may have signs of MD, but carry none of the currently recognized genetic mutations.
Studies of other related muscle diseases may, however, contribute to what we know about MD.
What Research Is Being Done on Epilepsy?
Researchers are studying the causes and risk factors that lead to sudden and unexpected death in individuals with epilepsy.
Other scientists are investigating novel, innovative approaches to studying the epilepsies.
Two new areas of research in the epilepsies include prevention of seizures anti-epileptogenesis and the role of inflammation in epilepsy.
Researchers are exploring the causes of epilepsy in individuals with specific genetic disorders Dravet Syndrome, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex, Rett Syndrome, as well as after traumatic brain injury, stroke, or a brain tumor in order to understand the underlying mechanisms that lead to seizures.
This research will provide the opportunity to develop new therapies designed to prevent epilepsy from developing in those individuals who are at high risk.

The 'flu shot' is an inactivated vaccine containing killed virus that is given with a needle, usually in the arm.
The flu shot is approved for use among people 6 months of age or older, including healthy people and those with chronic medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease.
A different kind of vaccine, called the nasal-spray flu vaccine sometimes referred to as LAIV for Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine or FluMist, was approved in 2003.
The nasal-spray flu vaccine contains attenuated weakened live viruses, and is administered by nasal sprayer.
It is approved for use only among healthy* people 2-49 years of age who are not pregnant.
Can chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis be cured?

This is a condition in which tissue deep in your lungs becomes scarred over time.
People who have this condition may need further treatment, such as oxygen therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation rehab.
What causes MS?
The last possibility has been the favored explanation for many years.
Research now suggests that the first two activities might also play a role in the development of MS.
There is a special barrier, called the blood-brain barrier, which separates the brain and spinal cord from the immune system.
If there is a break in the barrier, it exposes the brain to the immune system for the first time.
When this happens, the immune system may misinterpret the brain as 'foreign.'.

Angiomyolipomas-benign growths consisting of fatty tissue and muscle cells-are the most common kidney lesions in TSC.
These growths are seen in the majority ofindividuals with TSC, but are also found in about one of every 300 people without TSC.
Angiomyolipomas caused by TSC are usually found in both kidneys and in most cases they produce no symptoms.
However, they can sometimes grow so large that they cause pain or kidney failure.
Bleeding from angiomyolipomas may also occur, causing both pain and weakness.
If severe bleeding does not stop naturally, there may severe blood loss, resulting in profound anemia and a life-threatening drop in blood pressure, warranting urgent medical attention.

These issues usually are minor and go away shortly after the tests are done.
CanH.
pylori infection be prevented?
No one knows for sure how H.
pylori spreads, so prevention is difficult.
Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine to prevent - and even cure - H.
pylori infection.
To help prevent infection, doctors advise people to.
How long after infection do symptoms appear?
Symptoms of giardiasis normally begin 1 to 3 weeks after becoming infected.
What Is Osteonecrosis?
The amount of disability that results from osteonecrosis depends on what part of the bone is affected, how large an area is involved, and how effectively the bone rebuilds itself.
Normally, bone continuously breaks down and rebuilds - old bone is replaced with new bone.
This process, which takes place after an injury as well as during normal growth, keeps the skeleton strong and helps it to maintain a balance of minerals.
In the course of osteonecrosis, however, the healing process is usually ineffective and the bone tissues break down faster than the body can repair them.
If left untreated, the disease progresses, the bone collapses, and the joint surface breaks down, leading to pain and arthritis.
How is GERD treated in children and adolescents?
Treatment for GERD for children and adolescents may involve one or more of the following, depending on the severity of symptoms: lifestyle changes, medications, or surgery.
What Are Holes in the Heart?
The heart has two sides, separated by an inner wall called the septum.
With each heartbeat, the right side of the heart receives oxygen-poor blood from the body and pumps it to the lungs.
The left side of the heart receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pumps it to the body.
What are the signs, symptoms, and types of treatment available forSalmonella infections?
Sometimes, people can become so sick from a Salmonella infection that they have to go to the hospital.
Infants, elderly persons, and those with weakened immune systems are more likely than others to develop severe illness.
When severe infection occurs, Salmonella may spread from the intestines to the bloodstream and then to other body sites and can cause death unless the person is treated promptly with antibiotics.
Looking back, has your perception of the attacks or the response changed from how you saw them ten years ago?
Anthrax attacks ushered in a new era in outbreak preparedness and response at national, state, and local levels.
CDC and the nation are much better prepared to respond today.
The attacks drove home the reality of the threat posed by terrorism and the need to be prepared to address the unexpected.
Numerous challenges remain, two of which are lack of surge capacity of the healthcare system in today's just in time economy and vulnerability to cyberterrorism.

Possible risk factors for rupture include hypertension, alcohol abuse, drug abuse particularly cocaine, and smoking.
In addition, the condition and size of the aneurysm affects the risk of rupture.
What should you expect before Catheter Ablation?
Stress testing.
Some heart problems are easier to diagnose when your heart is working hard and beating fast.
During stress testing, you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests are done.
If you can't exercise, you may be given medicine to raise your heart rate.
What is an upper gastrointestinal GI series?
An upper GI series, also called a barium swallow, uses x rays and fluoroscopy to help diagnose problems of the upper GI tract.
An x ray is a picture created by using radiation and recorded on film or on a computer.
Fluoroscopy is a form of x ray that makes it possible to see the internal organs and their motion on a video monitor.
To make the upper GI tract more visible on x ray, a health care provider will fill the person's upper GI tract with a chalky liquid called barium.
The two types of upper GI series are.

The connection between celiac disease and these diseases may be genetic.
They include.
Why was BSL-3-enhanced containment used for work on the 1918 H1N1 virus when most human influenza viruses of the H1N1 subtype are handled under much less stringent containment?
The appropriate biosafety measures for working a given pathogen depend upon a number of factors, including previous experience with the pathogen or similar pathogens, the virulence and transmissibility of the pathogen, the type of experiment, and the availability of vaccines and/or antimicrobial drugs effective against the pathogen.
Prior to reconstruction of the 1918 virus, CDC carefully evaluated the specific studies to be conducted and concluded that this research could safely and securely be done under BSL-3-enhanced containment.
All viruses containing one or more gene segments from the 1918 influenza virus were generated and handled under high-containment BSL 3-enhanced laboratory conditions in accordance with guidelines of NIH and CDC.
The recommendations for biosafety levels are made by a panel of experts and are followed in a stringent manner.
What causes HD?
Before birth, a child's nerve cells normally grow along the intestines in the direction of the anus.
With HD, the nerve cells stop growing too soon.
Why the nerve cells stop growing is unclear.
Some HD is inherited, meaning it is passed from parent to child through genes.
HD is not caused by anything a mother did while pregnant.
Is there any treatment for Cushing's Syndrome?
Treatment of Cushing's syndrome depends on the cause of excess cortisol.
If the cause is long-term use of a medication being used to treat another disorder, the physician may reduce the dosage until symptoms are under control.
Surgery or radiotherapy may be used to treat pituitary adenomas.
Surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or a combination of these may be used to treat ectopic ACTH syndrome.
The aim of surgical treatment is to cure hypercortisolism by removing the tumor while minimizing the chance of endocrine deficiency or long-term dependence on medications.
The U.S.
Food and Drug Administration has approved pasireotide diasparate, taken by injection, for individuals who cannot be helped through surgery.
What is the prognosis for Polymyositis?
The prognosis for polymyositis varies.
Most people respond fairly well to therapy, but some have a more severe disease that does not respond adequately to therapies and are left with significant disability.
In rare cases individuals with severe and progressive muscle weakness will develop respiratory failure or pneumonia.
Difficulty swallowing may cause weight loss and malnutrition.
Is there any treatment for Neurological Complications of Lyme Disease?
Lyme disease is treated with antibiotics under the supervision of a physician.
What is Targeted therapy?
Targeted therapy is a treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells.
Could a 1918-like H1N1 virus re-emerge and cause a pandemic again?
It is impossible to predict with certainly, but the probability of the 1918 virus re-emerging from a natural source appears to be remote.
Influenza experts believe that a pandemic is most likely to be caused by an influenza subtype to which there is little, or no, preexisting immunity in the human population.
There is evidence that some residual immunity to the 1918 virus, or a similar virus, is present in at least a portion of the human population.
Since contemporary H1N1 viruses circulate widely and the current annual influenza vaccines contain an H1N1 component, a 1918-like H1N1 virus would not fit the current criteria for a new pandemic strain.
Who Is at Risk for Sudden Cardiac Arrest?
The risk of sudden cardiac arrest SCA increases with age.
The risk also is higher if you have underlying heart disease.
Men are two to three times more likely to have SCA than women.
How Are Congenital Heart Defects Diagnosed?
Severe congenital heart defects generally are diagnosed during pregnancy or soon after birth.
Less severe defects often aren't diagnosed until children are older.
How is back pain treated?
Exercise may be the most effective way to speed recovery from low back pain and help strengthen back and abdominal muscles.
Maintaining and building muscle strength is particularly important for persons with skeletal irregularities.
Doctors and physical therapists can provide a list of gentle exercises that help keep muscles moving and speed the recovery process.
A routine of back-healthy activities may include stretching exercises, swimming, walking, and movement therapy to improve coordination and develop proper posture and muscle balance.
Yoga is another way to gently stretch muscles and ease pain.
Any mild discomfort felt at the start of these exercises should disappear as muscles become stronger.
But if pain is more than mild and lasts more than 15 minutes during exercise, patients should stop exercising and contact a doctor.
How many people have these disorders?
Batten disease and other forms of NCL are relatively rare, occurring in an estimated 2 to 4 of every 100,000 live births in the United States.
These disorders appear to be more common in Finland, Sweden, other parts of northern Europe, and Newfoundland, Canada.
Although NCLs are classified as rare diseases, they often strike more than one person in families that carry the defective genes.
How Will the Doctor Help?
After the doctor knows what kind of arthritis you have, he or she will talk with you about the best way to treat it.

What isStachybotrys chartarumStachybotrys atra?
Stachybotrys chartarum also known by its synonym Stachybotrys atra is a greenish-black mold.
It can grow on material with a high cellulose and low nitrogen content, such as fiberboard, gypsum board, paper, dust, and lint.
Growth occurs when there is moisture from water damage, excessive humidity, water leaks, condensation, water infiltration, or flooding.
Constant moisture is required for its growth.
It is not necessary, however, to determine what type of mold you may have.
All molds should be treated the same with respect to potential health risks and removal.
What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Heart Failure?
Fluid buildup from heart failure also causes weight gain, frequent urination, and a cough that's worse at night and when you're lying down.
This cough may be a sign of acute pulmonary edema e-DE-ma.

There is currently no cure.
What is Stroke?
A stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is suddenly interrupted or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts, spilling blood into the spaces surrounding brain cells.
Brain cells die when they no longer receive oxygen and nutrients from the blood or there is sudden bleeding into or around the brain.
The symptoms of a stroke include sudden numbness or weakness, especially on one side of the body; sudden confusion or trouble speaking or understanding speech; sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes; sudden trouble with walking, dizziness, or loss of balance or coordination; or sudden severe headache with no known cause.
There are two forms of stroke: ischemic - blockage of a blood vessel supplying the brain, and hemorrhagic - bleeding into or around the brain.

Just be sure to still keep the humidity level between 30 and 60 percent.
Who Is at Risk for These Problems?
'I was training really hard - all the time.
Finally, my parents made me quit the cross country team.I was eating almost nothing, training with a stress fracture.I trained even when my body ached.
I thought the pain, the headaches, and the missed menstrual periods were normal.
I thought that was how a 'champion' was supposed to feel and train.
I was proud of myself for being so thin and disciplined, and losing all the 'baby fat' I had carried throughout junior high school.
My friends all said, 'Gosh, you have lost so much weight!' But I wasn't in control.
After my parents made me quit the team and took me to get help, I realized that my training regimen was not normal or healthy.
I realized that I was hurting myself, and that I did not have to be obsessive about my weight, eating habits, and exercise in order to be attractive.
I still exercise now, and I watch what I eat, but I am much more relaxed, healthier my doctor says!, and happier.
I have more energy - and more fun.
I don't have to set any records anymore, and I am a champion anyway!'
What is Standards for judging what?
Standards for judging what is an acceptable, tolerable, or normal quantity of mold have not been established.
What Causes Coronary Microvascular Disease?
Older age.
As you get older, your risk for atherosclerosis increases.
Genetic or lifestyle factors cause plaque to build up in your arteries as you age.
By the time you're middle-aged or older, enough plaque has built up to cause signs and symptoms.
In men, the risk increases after age 45.
In women, the risk increases after age 55.
What research is being done for Porencephaly?
The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health NIH conduct research related to porencephaly in laboratories at the NIH and also support additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country.
Much of this research explores the complex mechanisms of normal brain development.
The knowledge gained from these fundamental studies will provide a foundation for developing ways to prevent porecephaly and the other cephalic disorders.
Is there any treatment for Repetitive Motion Disorders?
Treatment for RMDs usually includes reducing or stopping the motions that cause symptoms.
Options include taking breaks to give the affected area time to rest, and adopting stretching and relaxation exercises.
Applying ice to the affected area and using medications such as pain relievers, cortisone, and anti-inflammatory drugs can reduce pain and swelling.
Splints may be able to relieve pressure on the muscles and nerves.
Physical therapy may relieve the soreness and pain in the muscles and joints.
In rare cases, surgery may be required to relieve symptoms and prevent permanent damage.
Some employers have developed ergonomic programs to help workers adjust their pace of work and arrange office equipment to minimize problems.
What Causes Osteonecrosis?
Osteonecrosis is caused by impaired blood supply to the bone, but it is not always clear what causes that impairment.
Osteonecrosis often occurs in people with certain medical conditions or risk factors such as high-dose corticosteroid use or excessive alcohol intake.
However, it also affects people with no health problems and for no known reason.
Following are some potential causes of osteonecrosis and other health conditions associated with its development.
How do the muscular dystrophies differ?
Duchenne MD usually becomes apparent during the toddler years, sometimes soon after an affected child begins to walk.
Progressive weakness and muscle wasting a decrease in muscle strength and size caused by degenerating muscle fibers begins in the upper legs and pelvis before spreading into the upper arms.
Other symptoms include loss of some reflexes, a waddling gait, frequent falls and clumsiness especially when running, difficulty when rising from a sitting or lying position or when climbing stairs, changes to overall posture, impaired breathing, lung weakness, and cardiomyopathy.
Many children are unable to run or jump.
The wasting muscles, in particular the calf muscles and, less commonly, muscles in the buttocks, shoulders, and arms, may be enlarged by an accumulation of fat and connective tissue, causing them to look larger and healthier than they actually are called pseudohypertrophy.
As the disease progresses, the muscles in the diaphragm that assist in breathing and coughing may weaken.
Affected individuals may experience breathing difficulties, respiratory infections, and swallowing problems.
Bone thinning and scoliosis curving of the spine are common.
Some affected children have varying degrees of cognitive and behavioral impairments.
Between ages 3 and 6, children may show brief periods of physical improvement followed later on by progressive muscle degeneration.
Children with Duchenne MD typically lose the ability to walk by early adolescence.
Without aggressive care, they usually die in their late teens or early twenties from progressive weakness of the heart muscle, respiratory complications, or infection.
However, improvements in multidisciplinary care have extended the life expectancy and improved the quality of life significantly for these children; numerous individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy now survive into their 30s, and some even into their 40s.

I have a medical condition.
Can I still do strength training?
It is important to start conservatively and progress slowly.
Consider working with a qualified fitness instructor, at least for a few sessions, to make sure your exercise form is correct.
Pay attention to your body.
Strength training should never cause pain.
Feeling good is an indication that you are exercising properly.
What is Diabetic neuropathy?
Diabetic neuropathy is a peripheral nerve disorder caused by diabetes or poor blood sugar control.
What is the prognosis for Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome?
Early identification of and treatment for individuals with neuroleptic malignant syndrome improves outcome.
If clinically indicated, a low potency neuroleptic can be reintroduced very slowly when the individual recovers, although there is a risk that the syndrome might recur.
Another alternative is to substitute another class of drugs for the neuroleptic.
Anesthesia may be a risk to individuals who have experienced neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
What is Cirrhosis?
Cirrhosis is a disease in which the liver is scarred.
What is Mumps vaccine?
Mumps vaccine is the best way to protect your child against mumps.
What is Flexible sigmoidoscopy?

How common is pancreatitis in children?
Chronic pancreatitis in children is rare.
Trauma to the pancreas and hereditary pancreatitis are two known causes of childhood pancreatitis.
Children with cystic fibrosis - a progressive and incurable lung disease - may be at risk of developing pancreatitis.
But more often the cause of pancreatitis in children is unknown.
What do I ask the doctor?
It helps to have questions for the doctor written down ahead of time.
Print this list of questions, and take it to your next appointment.
You may want to ask a family member or close friend to come with you to take notes.
What is cirrhosis?
The buildup of scar tissue that causes cirrhosis is usually a slow and gradual process.
In the early stages of cirrhosis, the liver continues to function.
However, as cirrhosis gets worse and scar tissue replaces more healthy tissue, the liver will begin to fail.
Chronic liver failure, which is also called end-stage liver disease, progresses over months, years, or even decades.
With end-stage liver disease, the liver can no longer perform important functions or effectively replace damaged cells.
What is Heart valve disease?
Heart valve disease is a lifelong condition.
What are the symptoms of primary biliary cirrhosis?
Some people may have jaundice, a condition that causes the skin and whites of the eyes to turn yellow.
Health care providers diagnose up to 60 percent of people with primary biliary cirrhosis before symptoms begin.
Routine blood tests showing abnormal liver enzyme levels may lead a health care provider to suspect that a person without symptoms has primary biliary cirrhosis.
Can the IRAT predict a future pandemic?
No.
The IRAT is an evaluative tool, not a predictive tool.
Flu is unpredictable, as are future pandemics.
What is Back pain?
Back pain is an all-too-familiar problem that can range from a dull, constant ache to a sudden, sharp pain that leaves you incapacitated.
What Is Juvenile Arthritis?
'Arthritis' means joint inflammation.
This term refers to a group of diseases that cause pain, swelling, stiffness, and loss of motion in the joints.
Arthritis is also used more generally to describe the more than 100 rheumatic diseases that may affect the joints but can also cause pain, swelling, and stiffness in other supporting structures of the body such as muscles, tendons, ligaments, and bones.
Some rheumatic diseases can affect other parts of the body, including various internal organs.
Juvenile arthritis JA is a term often used to describe arthritis in children.
Children can develop almost all types of arthritis that affect adults, but the most common type that affects children is juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Restless Legs Syndrome?
A strong urge to move your legs.
This urge often, but not always, occurs with unpleasant feelings in your legs.
When the disorder is severe, you also may have the urge to move your arms.
How is TS diagnosed?
TS is a diagnosis that doctors make after verifying that the patient has had both motor and vocal tics for at least 1 year.
The existence of other neurological or psychiatric conditions can also help doctors arrive at a diagnosis.
Common tics are not often misdiagnosed by knowledgeable clinicians.
However, atypical symptoms or atypical presentations for example, onset of symptoms in adulthood may require specific specialty expertise for diagnosis.
There are no blood, laboratory, or imaging tests needed for diagnosis.
In rare cases, neuroimaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging MRI or computerized tomography CT, electroencephalogram EEG studies, or certain blood tests may be used to rule out other conditions that might be confused with TS when the history or clinical examination is atypical.
What antiviral drugs are recommended this flu season?
There are two FDA-approved influenza antiviral drugs recommended by CDC this season.
The brand names for these are Tamiflu generic name oseltamivir and Relenza generic name zanamivir.
Tamiflu is available as a pill or liquid and Relenza is a powder that is inhaled.
Relenza is not for people with breathing problems like asthma or COPD, for example..
What is Whipple's Disease?
Whipple's disease is a multi-system infectious bacterial disease that interferes with the body's ability to metabolize fats.
The disorder can affect any system in the body, including the central nervous system, but usually occurs in the gastrointestinal system.
Gastrointestinal symptoms may include diarrhea, weight loss, fatigue, weakness, and abdominal bleeding and pain.
Neurological symptoms may include abnormalities of eye and facial muscle movements, confusion, seizures, ataxia, memory loss, and vision impairment.
Fever, cough, and joint soreness may also be present.
What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Thalassemias?
A lack of oxygen in the bloodstream causes the signs and symptoms of thalassemias.
The lack of oxygen occurs because the body doesn't make enough healthy red blood cells and hemoglobin.
The severity of symptoms depends on the severity of the disorder.
What is celiac disease?
Celiac disease is both a disease of malabsorption - meaning nutrients are not absorbed properly - and an abnormal immune reaction to gluten.
Celiac disease is also known as celiac sprue, nontropical sprue, and gluten-sensitive enteropathy.
Celiac disease is genetic, meaning it runs in families.
Sometimes the disease is triggered - or becomes active for the first time - after surgery, pregnancy, childbirth, viral infection, or severe emotional stress.
What Is High Blood Pressure?
Blood pressure is considered high if it stays at or above 140/90 mmHg over time.
If you have diabetes or chronic kidney disease, high blood pressure is defined as 130/80 mmHg or higher.
A diagnosis of high blood pressure is based on an average of two or more properly measured, seated blood pressure readings done during two or more office visits.
What is Vasculitis?
Vasculitis is an inflammation of blood vessels, which includes the veins, arteries, and capillaries.
What If I Still Hurt?
If you still hurt after using your medicine correctly and doing one or more of these things, call your doctor.
Another kind of medicine might work better for you.
Some people can also benefit from surgery, such as joint replacement.
I am breast feeding my 2-month-old baby.
Is it safe for me to receive the MMR vaccine?
Yes.
Breast feeding does not interfere with the response to MMR vaccine, and your baby will not be affected by the vaccine through your breast milk.
Is there any treatment for Friedreich's Ataxia?
There is currently no effective cure or treatment for Friedreich's ataxia.
However, many of the symptoms and accompanying complications can be treated to help patients maintain optimal functioning as long as possible.
Diabetes and heart problems can be treated with medications.
Orthopedic problems such as foot deformities and scoliosis can be treated with braces or surgery.
Physical therapy may prolong use of the arms and legs.
What are the symptoms?
Cataplexy is a sudden loss of muscle tone while the person is awake that leads to feelings of weakness and a loss of voluntary muscle control.
Attacks can occur at any time during the waking period, with individuals usually experiencing their first episodes several weeks or months after the onset of EDS.
But in about 10 percent of all cases, cataplexy is the first symptom to appear and can be misdiagnosed as a seizure disorder.
Cataplectic attacks vary in duration and severity.
The loss of muscle tone can be barely perceptible, involving no more than a momentary sense of slight weakness in a limited number of muscles, such as mild drooping of the eyelids.
The most severe attacks result in a complete loss of tone in all voluntary muscles, leading to physical collapse during which individuals are unable to move, speak, or keep their eyes open.
But even during the most severe episodes, people remain fully conscious, a characteristic that distinguishes cataplexy from seizure disorders.
Although cataplexy can occur spontaneously, it is more often triggered by sudden, strong emotions such as fear, anger, stress, excitement, or humor.
Laughter is reportedly the most common trigger.
What is bat influenza flu?
Bat influenza refers to influenza A viruses found in bats.
Bat influenza was first discovered in 'little yellow-shouldered bats' in Guatemala during a study conducted in 2009 and 2010 by experts from CDC and the Universidad del Valle University of the Valley in Guatemala*.
Bat influenza viruses have only been detected in little yellow-shouldered bats at this time.
Additional testing is needed to determine if bat influenza viruses are found in other types of bats.
Laboratory research at CDC suggests these viruses would need to undergo significant changes to become capable of infecting and spreading easily among humans.
Little yellow shouldered bats are not native to the continental United States, but are common in Central and South America.
What do People With Lactose Intolerance Need to Know About Osteoporosi?
xml-splitTrecTrim/33578343.xml:
Are current antivirals and vaccines effective against the 1918 virus?
Yes.
Two types of antiviral drugs, rimantadine Flumadine and oseltamivir Tamiflu, have been shown to be effective against influenza viruses similar to the 1918 virus.
Vaccines containing the 1918 HA or other subtype H1 HA proteins were effective in protecting mice against the 1918 virus.
In fact, the current influenza vaccine provided some level of protection against the 1918 virus in mice.
What Are the Symptoms of Paget's Disease?
Heart failure.
If Paget's disease is extensive, the heart may have to work harder to pump blood to the affected areas.
For people who have pre-existing heart disease, this added work can lead to heart failure, a condition in which the heart is unable to deliver enough blood to meet the body's needs.
What Causes Patent Ductus Arteriosus?
If your child has patent ductus arteriosus PDA, you may think you did something wrong during your pregnancy to cause the problem.
However, the cause of patent ductus arteriosus isn't known.
What is Biologic therapy?
Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer.
What is Spinal stenosis?
Spinal stenosis is the narrowing of the spinal canal, through which the spinal cord and spinal nerves run.
Who is more likely to develop hemochromatosis?
Both men and women can inherit the gene defects for hemochromatosis; however, not all will develop the symptoms of hemochromatosis.
Men usually develop symptoms at a younger age than women.
Women lose blood - which contains iron - regularly during menstruation; therefore, women with the gene defects that cause hemochromatosis may not develop iron overload and related symptoms and complications until after menopause.
What research is being done for Mucopolysaccharidoses?
The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS conducts research in its laboratories at the National Institutes of Health NIH and also supports additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country.
Currently, scientists are working to identify the genes associated with the mucopolysaccharidoses syndromes and plan to test new therapies in animal models and in humans.
Research funded by the Institute has shown that viral-delivered gene therapy in animal models of the mucopolysaccharidoses can stop the buildup of storage materials in brain cells and improve learning and memory.
Researchers are planning additional studies, but it may be years before such treatment is available to humans.
How is Guillain-Barre treated?
Currently, plasma exchange also called plasmapheresis and high-dose immunoglobulin therapy are used.
Both of them are equally effective, but immunoglobulin is easier to administer.
Plasma exchange is a method by which whole blood is removed from the body and processed so that the red and white blood cells are separated from the plasma, or liquid portion of the blood.
The blood cells are then returned to the patient without the plasma, which the body quickly replaces.
Scientists still don't know exactly why plasma exchange works, but the technique seems to reduce the severity and duration of the Guillain-Barre episode.
This may be because plasmapheresis can remove antibodies and other immune cell-derived factors that could contribute to nerve damage.
Will I Need to Take Medicine for My Bones?
There are medicines to help prevent and treat osteoporosis.
Your doctor may want you to take medicine if your bone density test shows that your bones are weak and that you have a good chance of breaking a bone in the future.
Your doctor is more likely to order medicine if you have other health concerns that increase your risk for breaking a bone, such as a tendency to fall or a low body weight.
What are the types of porphyria?
Each of the eight types of porphyria corresponds to low levels of a specific enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway.

I look at the size tags on the clothes that fit me now and think, 'What could be better than this?
I developed a nerve problem in my face, and the medication I had to take for it made me gain even more weight.
It got to the point where none of my clothes fit me anymore.
I had nothing to wear.
I felt horrible emotionally and physically.
It was all I could think about.
I would spend all day trying to figure out how to fix this problem.
How is MSA diagnosed?
After taking a clinical history and performing a brief neurological examination, a doctor may order a number of tests to help make the diagnosis.
These tests include autonomic function tests, urine analysis and other tests to assess bladder function, and neuroimaging.
An MRI magnetic resonance imaging of the brain is done since there are some changes that seem to be specific for MSA.
MRI uses computer-generated radio waves and a powerful magnetic field to produce detailed images of body structures including tissues, organs, bones, and nerves.
A research PET scan positron emission tomography, which allows doctors to see how organs and tissues are functioning is sometimes used to see if metabolic function is reduced in specific parts of the brain that are associated with MSA.
A DaTSCAN measures dopamine transporter cells and can help physicians determine if the condition is caused by a dopamine system disorder such as Parkinson's disease or essential tremor.
Individuals with MSA typically have no improvement in their symptoms with levodopa, a drug used to treat Parkinson's disease, although this lack of response is not diagnostic of MSA.
What research is being done for Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker Disease?
The NINDS supports and conducts research on TSEs, including GSS.
Much of this research is aimed at characterizing the agents that cause these disorders, clarifying the mechanisms underlying them, and, ultimately, finding ways to prevent, treat, and cure them.
What is the prognosis for Vasculitis Syndromes of the Central and Peripheral Nervous Systems?
The prognosis is dependent upon the specific syndrome, however, most of the syndromes are fatal if left untreated.
When do I need to get the seasonal flu shot?
Get the flu shot soon after it's available each year.
After you get the vaccine, your body takes about 2 weeks to develop protection against the flu.
That's why it's a good idea to get the vaccine before flu starts spreading in your community.
Can stress make Crohn's disease worse?
People with Crohn's disease sometimes feel more stress in their lives, which can make symptoms worse.
Eating well, getting enough rest, and learning to relax may help you through stressful times.
Support groups may help lower stress for people with Crohn's disease.
Ask your health care provider for help finding support groups.

What is Stage 0 colon cancer?
Stage 0 colon cancer is the most superficial of all the lesions and is limited to the mucosa without invasion of the lamina propria.
What is NF2?
This rare disorder affects about 1 in 25,000 people.
Approximately 50 percent of affected people inherit the disorder; in others the disorder is caused by a spontaneous genetic mutation of unknown cause.
The hallmark finding in NF2 is the presence of slow-growing tumors on the eighth cranial nerves.
These nerves have two branches: the acoustic branch helps people hear by transmitting sound sensations to the brain; and the vestibular branch helps people maintain their balance.
The characteristic tumors of NF2 are called vestibular schwannomas because of their location and the types of cells involved.
As these tumors grow, they may press against and damage nearby structures such as other cranial nerves and the brain stem, the latter which can cause serious disability.
Schwannomas in NF2 may occur along any nerve in the body, including the spinal nerves, other cranial nerves, and peripheral nerves in the body.
These tumors may be seen as bumps under the skin when the nerves involved are just under the skin surface or can also be seen on the skin surface as small less than 1 inch, dark, rough areas of hairy skin.
In children, tumors may be smoother, less pigmented, and less hairy.
What is Stiff-Person Syndrome?
Stiff-person syndrome SPS is a rare neurological disorder with features of an autoimmune disease.
SPS is characterized by fluctuating muscle rigidity in the trunk and limbs and a heightened sensitivity to stimuli such as noise, touch, and emotional distress, which can set off muscle spasms.
Abnormal postures, often hunched over and stiffened, are characteristic of the disorder.
People with SPS can be too disabled to walk or move, or they are afraid to leave the house because street noises, such as the sound of a horn, can trigger spasms and falls.
SPS affects twice as many women as men.
It is frequently associated with other autoimmune diseases such as diabetes, thyroiditis, vitiligo, and pernicious anemia.
Scientists don't yet understand what causes SPS, but research indicates that it is the result of an autoimmune response gone awry in the brain and spinal cord.
The disorder is often misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, psychosomatic illness, or anxiety and phobia.
A definitive diagnosis can be made with a blood test that measures the level of glutamic acid decarboxylase GAD antibodies in the blood.
People with SPS have elevated levels of GAD, an antibody that works against an enzyme involved in the synthesis of an important neurotransmitter in the brain.
What is A pacemaker?
A pacemaker is a small device that's placed in the chest or abdomen to help control abnormal heart rhythms.
What causes Guillain-Barre syndrome?
When Guillain-Barre is preceded by a viral or bacterial infection, it is possible that the virus has changed the nature of cells in the nervous system so that the immune system treats them as foreign cells.
It is also possible that the virus makes the immune system itself less discriminating about what cells it recognizes as its own, allowing some of the immune cells, such as certain kinds of lymphocytes and macrophages, to attack the myelin.
Sensitized T lymphocytes cooperate with B lymphocytes to produce antibodies against components of the myelin sheath and may contribute to destruction of the myelin.
In two forms of GBS, axons are attacked by antibodies against the bacteria Campylobacter jejuni, which react with proteins of the peripheral nerves.
Acute motor axonal neuropathy is particularly common in Chinese children.
Scientists are investigating these and other possibilities to find why the immune system goes awry in Guillain-Barre syndrome and other autoimmune diseases.
The cause and course of Guillain-Barre syndrome is an active area of neurological investigation, incorporating the cooperative efforts of neurological scientists, immunologists, and virologists.
What should you expect after a Nuclear Heart Scan?

What research is being done for Holmes-Adie syndrome?
The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS, and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health NIH, support research related to HAS through grants to major research institutions across the country.
Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure disorders, such as HAS.
A qualified environmental lab took samples of the mold in my home and gave me the results.
Can CDC interpret these results?
Standards for judging what is an acceptable, tolerable, or normal quantity of mold have not been established.
If you do decide to pay for environmental sampling for molds, before the work starts, you should ask the consultants who will do the work to establish criteria for interpreting the test results.
They should tell you in advance what they will do or what recommendations they will make based on the sampling results.
The results of samples taken in your unique situation cannot be interpreted without physical inspection of the contaminated area or without considering the building's characteristics and the factors that led to the present condition.

What is Acute basophilic leukemia?
Acute basophilic leukemia is an AML that exhibits a primary differentiation to basophils.
What is Osteopenia?
Osteopenia is a condition in which the bones become less dense, making them weaker.
What is the prognosis for Dystonias?
The initial symptoms can be very mild and may be noticeable only after prolonged exertion, stress, or fatigue.
Dystonias often progress through various stages.
Initially, dystonic movements are intermittent and appear only during voluntary movements or stress.
Later, individuals may show dystonic postures and movements while walking and ultimately even while they are relaxed.
Dystonic motions may lead to permanent physical deformities by causing tendons to shorten.
How are cerebral aneurysms diagnosed?
Angiography is a dye test used to analyze the arteries or veins.
An intracerebral angiogram can detect the degree of narrowing or obstruction of an artery or blood vessel in the brain, head, or neck, and can identify changes in an artery or vein such as a weak spot like an aneurysm.
It is used to diagnose stroke and to precisely determine the location, size, and shape of a brain tumor, aneurysm, or blood vessel that has bled.
This test is usually performed in a hospital angiography suite.
Following the injection of a local anesthetic, a flexible catheter is inserted into an artery and threaded through the body to the affected artery.
A small amount of contrast dye one that is highlighted on x-rays is released into the bloodstream and allowed to travel into the head and neck.
A series of x-rays is taken and changes, if present, are noted.
What Is Marfan Syndrome?
Marfan syndrome most often affects the connective tissue of the heart and blood vessels, eyes, bones, lungs, and covering of the spinal cord.
Because the condition affects many parts of the body, it can cause many complications.
Sometimes the complications are life threatening.
What Are the Risks of a Lung Ventilation/Perfusion Scan?
Lung ventilation/perfusion VQ scans involve little risk for most people.
The radioisotopes used for both tests expose you to a small amount of radiation.
The amount of radiation in the gas and injection together are about the same as the amount a person is naturally exposed to in 1 year.
What is Porencephaly?
Porencephaly is an extremely rare disorder of the central nervous system in which a cyst or cavity filled with cerebrospinal fluid develops in the brain.
It is usually the result of damage from stroke or infection after birth the more common type, but it can also be caused by abnormal development before birth which is inherited and less common.
Diagnosis is usually made before an infant reaches his or her first birthday.
Symptoms of porencephaly include delayed growth and development, spastic hemiplegia slight or incomplete paralysis, hypotonia low muscle tone, seizures often infantile spasms, and macrocephaly large head or microcephaly small head.
Children with porencephaly may have poor or absent speech development, epilepsy, hydrocephalus accumulation of fluid in the brain, spastic contractures shrinkage or shortening of the muscles, and mental retardation.

What Causes Atherosclerosis?
When this happens, blood cell fragments called platelets PLATE-lets stick to the site of the injury.
They may clump together to form blood clots.
Clots narrow the arteries even more, limiting the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your body.
What is A heart murmur?
A heart murmur is an extra or unusual sound heard during a heartbeat.
What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia?
PCD also can cause fertility problems in men and women.
Fertility refers to the ability to have children.
In men, PCD can affect cilia-like structures that help sperm cells move.
Because the sperm cells don't move well, men who have the disease usually are unable to father children.
What is Iron deficiency?
Iron deficiency is a condition resulting from too little iron in the body.

Influenza the flu can be a serious disease that can lead to hospitalization and sometimes even death.
Anyone can get very sick from the flu, including people who are otherwise healthy.
What causes trigeminal neuralgia?
TN is associated with a variety of conditions.
TN can be caused by a blood vessel pressing on the trigeminal nerve as it exits the brain stem.
This compression causes the wearing away or damage to the protective coating around the nerve the myelin sheath.
TN symptoms can also occur in people with multiple sclerosis, a disease that causes deterioration of the trigeminal nerve's myelin sheath.
Rarely, symptoms of TN may be caused by nerve compression from a tumor, or a tangle of arteries and veins called an arteriovenous malformation.
Injury to the trigeminal nerve perhaps the result of sinus surgery, oral surgery, stroke, or facial trauma may also produce neuropathic facial pain.
What Causes Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia?

How many carotid endarterectomies are performed each year?
An estimated 140,000 carotid endarterectomies were performed in the United States in 2009, according to the National Hospital Discharge Survey.
The procedure was first described in the mid-1950s.
It began to be used increasingly as a stroke prevention measure in the 1960s and 1970s.
Its use peaked in the mid-1980s when more than 100,000 operations were performed each year.
At that time, several authorities began to question the trend and the risk-benefit ratio for some groups, and the use of the procedure dropped precipitously.
The NINDS-supported NASCET and ACAS trials were launched in the mid-1980s to identify the specific groups of people with carotid artery disease who would clearly benefit from the procedure.
What is A cerebral aneurysm?
A cerebral aneurysm is a weak or thin spot on a blood vessel in the brain that balloons out and fills with blood.

What is the prognosis for Paroxysmal Choreoathetosis?
Generally, paroxysmal choreoathetosis lessens with age, and many adults have a complete remission.
Because drug therapy is so effective, the prognosis for the disorder is good.
What are the signs and symptoms?
Symptoms typically begin between the ages of 5 and 15 years, although they sometimes appear in adulthood and on rare occasions as late as age 75.
The first symptom to appear is usually gait ataxia, or difficulty walking.
The ataxia gradually worsens and slowly spreads to the arms and the trunk.
There is often loss of sensation in the extremities, which may spread to other parts of the body.
Other features include loss of tendon reflexes, especially in the knees and ankles.
Most people with Friedreich's ataxia develop scoliosis a curving of the spine to one side, which often requires surgical intervention for treatment.

The NINDS conducts and supports a broad range of research on motor neuron diseases.
The goals of these studies are to increase understanding of these disorders and to find ways to treat, prevent, and ultimately cure them.
What are the different types of hydrocephalus?
Hydrocephalus may be congenital or acquired.
Congenital hydrocephalus is present at birth and may be caused by either events or influences that occur during fetal development, or genetic abnormalities.
Acquired hydrocephalus develops at the time of birth or at some point afterward.
This type of hydrocephalus can affect individuals of all ages and may be caused by injury or disease.
Hydrocephalus may also be communicating or non-communicating.
Communicating hydrocephalus occurs when the flow of CSF is blocked after it exits the ventricles.
This form is called communicating because the CSF can still flow between the ventricles, which remain open.
Non-communicating hydrocephalus - also called obstructive hydrocephalus - occurs when the flow of CSF is blocked along one or more of the narrow passages connecting the ventricles.
One of the most common causes of hydrocephalus is aqueductal stenosis.
In this case, hydrocephalus results from a narrowing of the aqueduct of Sylvius, a small passage between the third and fourth ventricles in the middle of the brain.

He or she also may ask about other symptoms, such as fatigue tiredness, lack of energy, and shortness of breath.
Women may be asked about their menopausal status.
What Treatments Are Available?
The term heritable disorders of connective tissue refers to a wide range of disorders, each requiring a specific program for management and treatment.
In most instances, regular monitoring is important to assess, for example, the diameter of the aorta in people with Marfan syndrome, the extent of scoliosis spine curvature in people with osteogenesis imperfecta and those with some forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and whether there is protrusion of the spine into the base of the skull in people with osteogenesis imperfecta.
For some conditions, specific metabolic treatment is useful, for example, vitamin B6 in people with homocystinuria, a metabolic disorder resulting from a liver enzyme deficiency.
In others, drugs like beta-blockers are useful for slowing the dilation of the aorta, and bone-building drugs called bisphosphonates may be help strengthen fragile bones.
Maintaining general health though a nutritious diet, exercise, and healthy lifestyle habits is also important for people with all heritable disorders of connective tissue.

It's one of the most common reasons people visit the doctor or nurse.
People are more likely to experience back pain as they get older.
What is the prognosis for these diseases?
The prognosis for polymyositis varies.
Most individuals respond fairly well to therapy, but some patients have a more severe disease that does not respond adequately to therapies and are left with significant disability.
In rare cases people with severe and progressive muscle weakness can have respiratory failure or pneumonia.
Difficulty swallowing can lead to becoming malnourished.
Falls leading to fractures particularly of the hip should be guarded against because of the high rate of disability or death that can result.
How can carpal tunnel syndrome be prevented?
At the workplace, workers can do on-the-job conditioning, perform stretching exercises, take frequent rest breaks, wear splints to keep wrists straight, and use correct posture and wrist position.
Wearing fingerless gloves can help keep hands warm and flexible.
Workstations, tools and tool handles, and tasks can be redesigned to enable the worker's wrist to maintain a natural position during work.
Jobs can be rotated among workers.
Employers can develop programs in ergonomics, the process of adapting workplace conditions and job demands to the capabilities of workers.
However, research has not conclusively shown that these workplace changes prevent the occurrence of carpal tunnel syndrome.
What is the prognosis for Fahr's Syndrome?
The prognosis for any individual with Fahr's Syndrome is variable and hard to predict.
There is no reliable correlation between age, extent of calcium deposits in the brain, and neurological deficit.
Since the appearance of calcification is age-dependent, a CT scan could be negative in a gene carrier who is younger than the age of 55.
What is A mechanical problem?
A mechanical problem is a problem with the way your spine moves or the way you feel when you move your spine in certain ways.
How is porphyria diagnosed?
A health care provider diagnoses porphyria with blood, urine, and stool tests.
These tests take place at a health care provider's office or a commercial facility.
A blood test involves drawing blood and sending the sample to a lab for analysis.
For urine and stool tests, the patient collects a sample of urine or stool in a special container.
A health care provider tests the samples in the office or sends them to a lab for analysis.
High levels of porphyrins or porphyrin precursors in blood, urine, or stool indicate porphyria.
A health care provider may also recommend DNA testing of a blood sample to look for known gene mutations that cause porphyrias.

What Types of Exercise Are Most Suitable for Someone With a Total Hip Replacement?
Proper exercise can reduce stiffness and increase flexibility and muscle strength.
People who have an artificial hip should talk to their doctor or physical therapist about developing an appropriate exercise program.
Most of these programs begin with safe range-of-motion activities and muscle-strengthening exercises.
The doctor or therapist will decide when you can move on to more demanding activities.
Many doctors recommend avoiding high-impact activities, such as basketball, jogging, and tennis.
These activities can damage the new hip or cause loosening of its parts.
Some recommended exercises are walking, stationary bicycling, swimming, and cross-country skiing.
These exercises can increase muscle strength and cardiovascular fitness without injuring the new hip.

xml-splitTrecTrim/33577029.xml:
What causes transverse myelitis?
In some people, transverse myeltis represents the first symptom of an underlying demyelinating disease of the central nervous system such as multiple sclerosis MS or neuromyelitis optica NMO.
A form of transverse myelitis known as partial myelitis--because it affects only a portion of the cross-sectional area of the spinal cord--is more characteristic of MS.
Neuromyelitis optica typically causes both transverse myelitis and optic neuritis inflammation of the optic nerve that results in visual loss, but not necessarily at the same time.
All patients with transverse myelitis should be evaluated for MS or NMO because patients with these diagnoses may require different treatments, especially therapies to prevent future attacks.
How do flu vaccines work?
The seasonal flu vaccine protects against three influenza viruses that research indicates will be most common during the upcoming season.
This season's flu vaccine provides protection against the three main viruses that research indicates will cause the most illness this season -- an influenza A H1N1 virus, an influenza A H3N2 virus and an influenza B virus.
About 2 weeks after vaccination, antibodies that provide protection against influenza virus infection develop in the body.
What is Stable angina?
Stable angina is the most common type of angina.
What is Meralgia Paresthetica?
Meralgia paresthetica is a disorder characterized by tingling, numbness, and burning pain in the outer side of the thigh.
The disorder is caused by compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, a sensory nerve to the skin, as it exits the pelvis.
People with the disorder often notice a patch of skin that is sensitive to touch and sometimes painful.
Meralgia paresthetica should not be associated with weakness or radiating pain from the back.
What is Echocardiography echo?

How are these syndromes diagnosed?
However, the diagnosis of vasculitis often requires evidence that there is ongoing inflammation.
Inflammatory cells may be found in the spinal fluid.
Often there is a need to conduct a tissue biopsy to examine blood vessels under a microscope.
In some cases a brain biopsy may be necessary to evaluate the compromised tissue.
A definitive diagnosis is important because the treatment usually requires powerful immune-suppressive drugs.
In addition, it is important to make sure that an infection is not causing the inflammation.

This is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating lung diseases and conditions.
What Research is Being Done?
Although HD attracted considerable attention from scientists in the early 20th century, there was little sustained research on the disease until the late 1960s when the Committee to Combat Huntington's Disease and the Huntington's Chorea Foundation, later called the Hereditary Disease Foundation, first began to fund research and to campaign for federal funding.
In 1977, Congress established the Commission for the Control of Huntington's Disease and Its Consequences, which made a series of important recommendations.
Since then, Congress has provided consistent support for federal research, primarily through the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the government's lead agency for biomedical research on disorders of the brain and nervous system.
The effort to combat HD proceeds along the following lines of inquiry, each providing important information about the disease:
What is Occipital neuralgia?
Occipital neuralgia is a distinct type of headache characterized by piercing, throbbing, or electric-shock-like chronic pain in the upper neck, back of the head, and behind the ears, usually on one side of the head.
What causes syringomyelia?
A number of medical conditions can cause an obstruction in the normal flow of CSF, redirecting excess fluid into the spinal cord and central canal.
This redirected CSF accumulates within the tissue of the spinal cord and forms a fluid-filled syrinx.
Pressure differences along the spine cause the fluid to move within the syrinx and outside the spinal cord.
Physicians believe that this continual movement of fluid in and around the spinal cord results in cyst growth and further damage to the spinal cord tissue.
What is Lactose intolerance?
Lactose intolerance is a common problem.
Is there any treatment for Tremor?
There is no cure for most tremors.
The appropriate treatment depends on accurate diagnosis of the cause.
Drug treatment for parkinsonian tremor involves levodopa or dopamine-like drugs such as pramipexole and ropinirole.
Essential tremor may be treated with propranolol or other beta blockers such as nadolol and primidone, an anticonvulsant drug.
Dystonic tremor may respond to clonazepam, anticholinergic drugs, and intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin.
Eliminating tremor triggers such as caffeine and other stimulants from the diet is often recommended.
Physical therapy may help to reduce tremor and improve coordination and muscle control for some individuals.
Surgical intervention, such as thalamotomy and deep brain stimulation, are usually performed only when the tremor is severe and does not respond to drugs.
What is Constipation?
Constipation is a condition in which a person has fewer than three bowel movements a week or has bowel movements with stools that are hard, dry, and small, making them painful or difficult to pass.
What Does Chest MRI Show?

What is Spasticity?
Spasticity is a condition in which there is an abnormal increase in muscle tone or stiffness of muscle, which might interfere with movement, speech, or be associated with discomfort or pain.
Spasticity is usually caused by damage to nerve pathways within the brain or spinal cord that control muscle movement.
It may occur in association with spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, stroke, brain or head trauma, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, hereditary spastic paraplegias, and metabolic diseases such as adrenoleukodystrophy, phenylketonuria, and Krabbe disease.
Symptoms may include hypertonicity increased muscle tone, clonus a series of rapid muscle contractions, exaggerated deep tendon reflexes, muscle spasms, scissoring involuntary crossing of the legs, and fixed joints contractures.
The degree of spasticity varies from mild muscle stiffness to severe, painful, and uncontrollable muscle spasms.
Spasticity can interfere with rehabilitation in patients with certain disorders, and often interferes with daily activities.
Who Is at Risk for Atelectasis?

What is Tay-Sachs Disease?
Infants with Tay-Sachs disease appear to develop normally for the first few months of life.
Then, as nerve cells become distended with fatty material, a relentless deterioration of mental and physical abilities occurs.
The child becomes blind, deaf, and unable to swallow.
Muscles begin to atrophy and paralysis sets in.
Other neurological symptoms include dementia, seizures, and an increased startle reflex to noise.
A much rarer form of the disorder occurs in patients in their twenties and early thirties and is characterized by an unsteady gait and progressive neurological deterioration.
Persons with Tay-Sachs also have cherry-red spots in their eyes.
The incidence of Tay-Sachs is particularly high among people of Eastern European and Askhenazi Jewish descent.
Patients and carriers of Tay-Sachs disease can be identified by a simple blood test that measures beta-hexosaminidase A activity.
Both parents must carry the mutated gene in order to have an affected child.
In these instances, there is a 25 percent chance with each pregnancy that the child will be affected with Tay-Sachs disease.
Prenatal diagnosis is available if desired.

How is Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease diagnosed?
Diagnosis of CMT begins with a standard medical history, family history, and neurological examination.
Individuals will be asked about the nature and duration of their symptoms and whether other family members have the disease.
During the neurological examination a physician will look for evidence of muscle weakness in the individual's arms, legs, hands, and feet, decreased muscle bulk, reduced tendon reflexes, and sensory loss.
Doctors look for evidence of foot deformities, such as high arches, hammertoes, inverted heel, or flat feet.
Other orthopedic problems, such as mild scoliosis or hip dysplasia, may also be present.
A specific sign that may be found in people with CMT1 is nerve enlargement that may be felt or even seen through the skin.
These enlarged nerves, called hypertrophic nerves, are caused by abnormally thickened myelin sheaths.
Is there any treatment for Migraine?
There is no absolute cure for migraine since its pathophysiology has yet to be fully understood.
There are two ways to approach the treatment of migraine headache with drugs: prevent the attacks, or relieve the symptoms during the attacks.
Prevention involves the use of medications and behavioral changes.
Drugs originally developed for epilepsy, depression, or high blood pressure to prevent future attacks have been shown to be extremely effective in treating migraine.
Botulinum toxin A has been shown to be effective in prevention of chronic migraine.
Behaviorally, stress management strategies, such as exercise, relaxation techniques, biofeedback mechanisms, and other therapies designed to limit daily discomfort, may reduce the number and severity of migraine attacks.
Making a log of personal triggers of migraine can also provide useful information for trigger-avoiding lifestyle changes, including dietary considerations, eating regularly scheduled meals with adequate hydration, stopping certain medications, and establishing a consistent sleep schedule.
Hormone therapy may help some women whose migraines seem to be linked to their menstrual cycle.
A weight loss program is recommended for obese individuals with migraine.

As children get older, lack of facial expression and inability to smile become the dominant visible symptoms.
Approximately 30 to 40 percent of children with Moebius syndrome have some degree of autism.
Is there any treatment for Headache?
When headaches occur three or more times a month, preventive treatment is usually recommended.
Drug therapy, biofeedback training, stress reduction, and elimination of certain foods from the diet are the most common methods of preventing and controlling migraine and other vascular headaches.
Regular exercise, such as swimming or vigorous walking, can also reduce the frequency and severity of migraine headaches.
Drug therapy for migraine is often combined with biofeedback and relaxation training.
One of the most commonly used drugs for the relief of migraine symptoms is sumatriptan.
Drugs used to prevent migraine also include methysergide maleate, which counteracts blood vessel constriction; propranolol hydrochloride, which also reduces the frequency and severity of migraine headaches; ergotamine tartrate, a vasoconstrictor that helps counteract the painful dilation stage of the headache; amitriptyline, an antidepressant; valproic acid, an anticonvulsant; and verapamil, a calcium channel blocker.
What are the possible complications of a shunt system?
Shunt systems are imperfect devices.
Complications may include mechanical failure, infections, obstructions, and the need to lengthen or replace the catheter.
Generally, shunt systems require monitoring and regular medical follow up.
When complications occur, subsequent surgery to replace the failed part or the entire shunt system may be needed.
Some complications can lead to other problems such as overdraining or underdraining.
Overdraining occurs when the shunt allows CSF to drain from the ventricles more quickly than it is produced.
Overdraining can cause the ventricles to collapse, tearing blood vessels and causing headache, hemorrhage subdural hematoma, or slit-like ventricles slit ventricle syndrome.
Underdraining occurs when CSF is not removed quickly enough and the symptoms of hydrocephalus recur.
Overdrainage and underdrainage of CSF are addressed by adjusting the drainage pressure of the shunt valve; if the shunt has an adjustable pressure valve these changes can be made by placing a special magnet on the scalp over the valve.
In addition to the common symptoms of hydrocephalus, infections from a shunt may also produce symptoms such as a low-grade fever, soreness of the neck or shoulder muscles, and redness or tenderness along the shunt tract.
When there is reason to suspect that a shunt system is not functioning properly for example, if the symptoms of hydrocephalus return, medical attention should be sought immediately.

Holmes-Adie syndrome HAS is a neurological disorder affecting the pupil of the eye and the autonomic nervous system.
What is Periventricular Leukomalacia?
Periventricular leukomalacia PVL is characterized by the death of the white matter of the brain due to softening of the brain tissue.
It can affect fetuses or newborns; premature babies are at the greatest risk of the disorder.
PVL is caused by a lack of oxygen or blood flow to the periventricular area of the brain, which results in the death or loss of brain tissue.
The periventricular area-the area around the spaces in the brain called ventricles-contains nerve fibers that carry messages from the brain to the body's muscles.
Although babies with PVL generally have no outward signs or symptoms of the disorder, they are at risk for motor disorders, delayed mental development, coordination problems, and vision and hearing impairments.
PVL may be accompanied by a hemorrhage or bleeding in the periventricular-intraventricular area the area around and inside the ventricles, and can lead to cerebral palsy.
The disorder is diagnosed by ultrasound of the head.

What are Encephaloceles?
Encephaloceles are rare neural tube defects characterized by sac-like protrusions of the brain and the membranes that cover it through openings in the skull.
These defects are caused by failure of the neural tube to close completely during fetal development.
The result is a groove down the midline of the upper part of the skull, or the area between the forehead and nose, or the back of the skull.
When located in the back of the skull, encephaloceles are often associated with neurological problems.
Usually encephaloceles are dramatic deformities diagnosed immediately after birth, but occasionally a small encephalocele in the nasal and forehead region can go undetected.
Encephaloceles are often accompanied by craniofacial abnormalities or other brain malformations.
Symptoms and associated abnormalities of encephaloceles may include hydrocephalus excessive accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, spastic quadriplegia paralysis of the arms and legs, microcephaly abnormally small head, ataxia uncoordinated movement of the voluntary muscles, such as those involved in walking and reaching, developmental delay, vision problems, mental and growth retardation, and seizures.
Some affected children may have normal intelligence.
There is a genetic component to the condition; it often occurs in families with a history of spina bifida and anencephaly in family members.

What is Trigeminal Neuralgia?
Trigeminal neuralgia TN, also called tic douloureux, is a chronic pain condition that causes extreme, sporadic, sudden burning or shock-like face pain.
The pain seldom lasts more than a few seconds or a minute or two per episode.
The intensity of pain can be physically and mentally incapacitating.
TN pain is typically felt on one side of the jaw or cheek.
Episodes can last for days, weeks, or months at a time and then disappear for months or years.
In the days before an episode begins, some patients may experience a tingling or numbing sensation or a somewhat constant and aching pain.
The attacks often worsen over time, with fewer and shorter pain-free periods before they recur.
The intense flashes of pain can be triggered by vibration or contact with the cheek such as when shaving, washing the face, or applying makeup, brushing teeth, eating, drinking, talking, or being exposed to the wind.
TN occurs most often in people over age 50, but it can occur at any age, and is more common in women than in men.
There is some evidence that the disorder runs in families, perhaps because of an inherited pattern of blood vessel formation.
Although sometimes debilitating, the disorder is not life-threatening.

What is the gastrointestinal GI tract?
The lower GI tract Your body digests food as it moves through the GI tract.
The leftover waste from the digested food enters your large intestine as liquid.
Your large intestine absorbs water and changes the liquid to a solid form called stool.
Stool passes from your colon to your rectum where it is stored before a bowel movement.
The muscles of your rectum move stool to your anus and out of your body.

Proctitis is inflammation of the lining of the rectum, the lower end of the large intestine leading to the anus.
The large intestine and anus are part of the gastrointestinal GI tract.
The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus.
The movement of muscles in the GI tract, along with the release of hormones and enzymes, allows for the digestion of food.
With proctitis, inflammation of the rectal lining - called the rectal mucosa - is uncomfortable and sometimes painful.
The condition may lead to bleeding or mucous discharge from the rectum, among other symptoms.
What are the symptoms?
AVMs also can cause a wide range of more specific neurological symptoms that vary from person to person, depending primarily upon the location of the AVM.

Children are characteristically quiet and apathetic.
Although Canavan disease may occur in any ethnic group, it is more frequent among Ashkenazi Jews from eastern Poland, Lithuania, and western Russia, and among Saudi Arabians.
Canavan disease can be identified by a simple prenatal blood test that screens for the missing enzyme or for mutations in the gene that controls aspartoacylase.
Both parents must be carriers of the defective gene in order to have an affected child.
When both parents are found to carry the Canavan gene mutation, there is a one in four 25 percent chance with each pregnancy that the child will be affected with Canavan disease.

How Can I Help Research on Epilepsy?
There are many ways that people with epilepsy and their families can help with research on this disorder.
Pregnant women with epilepsy who are taking antiepileptic drugs can help researchers learn how these drugs affect unborn children by participating in the Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry, which is maintained by the Genetics and Teratology Unit of Massachusetts General Hospital see section on Pregnancy and Motherhood.
People with epilepsy that may be hereditary can aid research by participating in the Epilepsy Gene Discovery Project, which is supported by the Epilepsy Foundation.
This project helps to educate people with epilepsy about new genetic research on the disorder and enlists families with hereditary epilepsy for participation in gene research.
People who enroll in this project are asked to create a family tree showing which people in their family have or have had epilepsy.
Researchers then examine this information to determine if the epilepsy is in fact hereditary, and they may invite participants to enroll in genetic research studies.
In many cases, identifying the gene defect responsible for epilepsy in an individual family leads researchers to new clues about how epilepsy develops.
It also can provide opportunities for early diagnosis and genetic screening of individuals in the family.

Can CDC interpret these results?
Standards for judging what is an acceptable, tolerable or normal quantity of mold have not been established.
If you do decide to pay for environmental sampling for molds, before the work starts, you should ask the consultants who will do the work to establish criteria for interpreting the test results.
They should tell you in advance what they will do or what recommendations they will make based on the sampling results.
The results of samples taken in your unique situation cannot be interpreted without physical inspection of the contaminated area or without considering the building's characteristics and the factors that led to the present condition.
How is stenosis treated?
Two large clinical trials evaluated the efficacy of carotid endarterectomy: the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial NASCET and the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study ACAS.
NASCET evaluated the risks and benefits of carotid endarterectomy for individuals who experienced a stroke or other symptoms due to the stenosis such as a mini stroke or transient ischemic attack TIA.
When performed by a qualified and experienced surgeon, carotid endarterectomy is a very effective stroke prevention therapy for patients with carotid stenosis-related symptoms and greater than 70 percent stenosis in the carotid arteries.
ACAS evaluated indivduals with asymptomatic stenosis, where a patient had no symptoms but the arterial blockage was identified in a medical exam.
These individuals have a low annual risk of stroke, about 2 to 3 percent per year, and carotid endarterectomy cut this risk in half.
In follow-up studies of otherwise healthy individuals five years post-surgery, the decreased annual stroke risk outweighed the risks of the carotid endarterectomy.
What is Shingles?
Shingles herpes zoster is an outbreak of rash or blisters on the skin that is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox - the varicella-zoster virus.
The first sign of shingles is often burning or tingling pain, or sometimes numbness or itch, in one particular location on only one side of the body.
After several days or a week, a rash of fluid-filled blisters, similar to chickenpox, appears in one area on one side of the body.
Shingles pain can be mild or intense.
Some people have mostly itching; some feel pain from the gentlest touch or breeze.
The most common location for shingles is a band, called a dermatome, spanning one side of the trunk around the waistline.
Anyone who has had chickenpox is at risk for shingles.
Scientists think that in the original battle with the varicella-zoster virus, some of the virus particles leave the skin blisters and move into the nervous system.
When the varicella-zoster virus reactivates, the virus moves back down the long nerve fibers that extend from the sensory cell bodies to the skin.
The viruses multiply, the tell-tale rash erupts, and the person now has shingles.

What is Essential Tremor?
Tremor is an unintentional, somewhat rhythmic, muscle movement involving to-and-fro movements oscillations of one or more parts of the body.
Essential tremor previously called benign essential tremor is the most common form of abnormal tremor.
In some people, tremor is a symptom of a neurological disorder or appears as a side effect of certain drugs.
Although it may be mild and nonprogressive in some people, in others the tremor is slowly progressive, starting on one side of the body but eventually affecting both sides.
Hand tremor is most common but the head, arms, voice, tongue, legs, and trunk may also be involved.
Hand tremor may cause problems with purposeful movements such as eating, writing, sewing, or shaving.
Head tremor may be seen as a yes-yes or no-no motion.
Essential tremor may be accompanied by mild gait disturbance.
Heightened emotion, stress, fever, physical exhaustion, or low blood sugar may trigger tremors or increase their severity.
There may be mild degeneration in the certain parts of the cerebellum in persons with essential tremor.
Onset is most common after age 40, although symptoms can appear at any age.
Children of a parent who has essential tremor have up to a 50 percent chance of inheriting the condition.
Essential tremor is not associated with any known pathology.

What is the Future of Pain Research?
Plasticity: Following injury, the nervous system undergoes a tremendous reorganization.
This phenomenon is known as plasticity.
For example, the spinal cord is rewired following trauma as nerve cell axons make new contacts, a phenomenon known as sprouting.
This in turn disrupts the cells' supply of trophic factors.
Scientists can now identify and study the changes that occur during the processing of pain.
For example, using a technique called polymerase chain reaction, abbreviated PCR, scientists can study the genes that are induced by injury and persistent pain.
There is evidence that the proteins that are ultimately synthesized by these genes may be targets for new therapies.
The dramatic changes that occur with injury and persistent pain underscore that chronic pain should be considered a disease of the nervous system, not just prolonged acute pain or a symptom of an injury.
Thus, scientists hope that therapies directed at preventing the long-term changes that occur in the nervous system will prevent the development of chronic pain conditions.
What Is Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura?

If the results are negative in-range result, it means that the baby's test results did not show signs of a CCHD.
This type of screening test does not detect all CCHDs, so it is possible to still have a critical or other heart defect with a negative screening result.
If the results are positive fail or out-of-range result, it means that the baby's test results showed low levels of oxygen in the blood.
This can be a sign of a CCHD.
This does not always mean that the baby has a CCHD.
It just means that more testing is needed.

What is Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome?
Lesch-Nyhan syndrome LNS is a rare, inherited disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase HPRT.
LNS is an X-linked recessive disease-- the gene is carried by the mother and passed on to her son.
LNS is present at birth in baby boys.
The lack of HPRT causes a build-up of uric acid in all body fluids, and leads to symptoms such as severe gout, poor muscle control, and moderate retardation, which appear in the first year of life.
A striking feature of LNS is self-mutilating behaviors - characterized by lip and finger biting - that begin in the second year of life.
Abnormally high uric acid levels can cause sodium urate crystals to form in the joints, kidneys, central nervous system, and other tissues of the body, leading to gout-like swelling in the joints and severe kidney problems.
Neurological symptoms include facial grimacing, involuntary writhing, and repetitive movements of the arms and legs similar to those seen in Huntington's disease.
Because a lack of HPRT causes the body to poorly utilize vitamin B12, some boys may develop a rare disorder called megaloblastic anemia.
What causes MSA?
The cause or causes of MSA are unknown.
The symptoms reflect the dysfunction and eventual loss of nerve cells in several different areas in the brain and spinal cord that control the autonomic nervous system and coordinate muscle movements.
The loss of nerve cells may be due to the buildup of a protein called alpha-synuclein in the cells that produce dopamine, a neurotransmitter that relays motor commands in the brain.
The buildup also occurs in other cells called oligodendroglia, which help transmit nerve signals.
MSA, along with Parkinson's disease and some other neurodegenerative conditions, are called synucleinopathies because they share a buildup of alpha-synuclein in brain cells.

What is Polymyositis?
Polymyositis is one of a group of muscle diseases known as the inflammatory myopathies, which are characterized by chronic muscle inflammation accompanied by muscle weakness.
Polymyositis affects skeletal muscles those involved with making movement on both sides of the body.
It is rarely seen in persons under age 18; most cases are in adults between the ages of 31 and 60.
Progressive muscle weakness starts in the proximal muscles muscles closest to the trunk of the body which eventually leads to difficulties climbing stairs, rising from a seated position, lifting objects, or reaching overhead.
People with polymyositis may also experience arthritis, shortness of breath, difficulty swallowing and speaking, and heart arrhythmias.
In some cases of polymyositis, distal muscles muscles further away from the trunk of the body, such as those in the forearms and around the ankles and wrists may be affected as the disease progresses.
Polymyositis may be associated with collagen-vascular or autoimmune diseases, such as lupus.
Polymyositis may also be associated with infectious disorders, such as HIV-AIDS.

What is the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool IRAT?
Ten scientific criteria are used to measure the potential pandemic risk associated with each of these scenarios.
These 10 criteria can be grouped into three overarching categories: 'properties of the virus,' 'attributes of the population,' and 'ecology & epidemiology of the virus.' Influenza subject matter experts will evaluate novel influenza viruses based on each of these 10 criteria.
Each of the 10 criteria is then weighted statistically based on its significance to each of the two scenarios.
A composite score for each virus is then calculated based on the given scenario.
These composite scores provide a means to rank and compare influenza viruses to each other in terms of their potential pandemic risk for each of the two scenarios.

What is Central Pain Syndrome?
Central pain syndrome is a neurological condition caused by damage to or dysfunction of the central nervous system CNS, which includes the brain, brainstem, and spinal cord.
This syndrome can be caused by stroke, multiple sclerosis, tumors, epilepsy, brain or spinal cord trauma, or Parkinson's disease.
The character of the pain associated with this syndrome differs widely among individuals partly because of the variety of potential causes.
Central pain syndrome may affect a large portion of the body or may be more restricted to specific areas, such as hands or feet.
The extent of pain is usually related to the cause of the CNS injury or damage.
Pain is typically constant, may be moderate to severe in intensity, and is often made worse by touch, movement, emotions, and temperature changes, usually cold temperatures.
Individuals experience one or more types of pain sensations, the most prominent being burning.
Mingled with the burning may be sensations of pins and needles; pressing, lacerating, or aching pain; and brief, intolerable bursts of sharp pain similar to the pain caused by a dental probe on an exposed nerve.
Individuals may have numbness in the areas affected by the pain.
The burning and loss of touch sensations are usually most severe on the distant parts of the body, such as the feet or hands.
Central pain syndrome often begins shortly after the causative injury or damage, but may be delayed by months or even years, especially if it is related to post-stroke pain.

Spina bifida SB is a neural tube defect a disorder involving incomplete development of the brain, spinal cord, and/or their protective coverings caused by the failure of the fetus's spine to close properly during the first month of pregnancy.
Infants born with SB sometimes have an open lesion on their spine where significant damage to the nerves and spinal cord has occurred.
Although the spinal opening can be surgically repaired shortly after birth, the nerve damage is permanent, resulting in varying degrees of paralysis of the lower limbs.
Even when there is no lesion present there may be improperly formed or missing vertebrae and accompanying nerve damage.
In addition to physical and mobility difficulties, most individuals have some form of learning disability.
The types of SB are: myelomeningocele, the severest form, in which the spinal cord and its protective covering the meninges protrude from an opening in the spine; meningocele in which the spinal cord develops normally but the meninges and spinal fluid protrude from a spinal opening; closed neural tube defects, which consist of a group of defects in which development of the spinal cord is affected by malformations of the fat, bone, or meninges; and and occulta, the mildest form, in which one or more vertebrae are malformed and covered by a layer of skin.
SB may also cause bowel and bladder complications, and many children with SB have hydrocephalus excessive accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain.

This work includes studies in animals to identify the molecular means by which ALS-causing gene mutations lead to the destruction of neurons.
To this end, scientists have developed models of ALS in a variety of animal species, including fruit flies, zebrafish, and rodents.
Initially, these genetically modified animal models focused on mutations in the SOD1 gene but more recently, models harboring other ALS-causing mutations also have been developed.
Research in these models suggests that depending on the gene mutation, motor neuron death is caused by a variety of cellular defects, including in the processing of RNA molecules and recycling of proteins, as well as impaired energy metabolism, and hyperactivation of motor neurons.
Increasing evidence also suggests that various types of glial support cells and inflammation cells of the nervous system play an important role in the disease.
What is Narcolepsy?
Narcolepsy is a chronic brain disorder that involves poor control of sleep-wake cycles.

Is there any treatment for Psychogenic Movement?
No single test can confirm psychogenic movement, which can prove difficult to diagnose.
Physicians must rule out co-existing conditions and other recognizable movement disorders.
There may be fluctuations during a neurological exam - particularly an increase of movement following attention and suggestion an external influence on the will of the patient, and a decrease when the person is distracted.
Electromyography EMG may be used to measure bursts of electrical activity from the brain and/or spinal cord to a peripheral nerve root found in the arms and legs that controls muscles during contraction and at rest.
Electroencephalography EEG can correlate the movement and detect any changes in electrical activity patterns produced by the brain.
Physicians also look for marked improvement in symptoms following psychotherapy, use of a placebo a medicine with no specific pharmacological benefit for the disorder being treated but given to see if it produces psychological or physical benefits, or suggestion.

Why is screening for critical congenital heart defects important?
Some babies born with a heart defect can appear healthy at first and can be sent home with their families before their heart defect is detected.
It has been estimated that at least 300 infants with an unrecognized CCHD are discharged each year from newborn nurseries in the United States.
These babies are at risk for having serious problems within the first few days or weeks of life and often require emergency care.
How is Zollinger-Ellison syndrome treated?
PPIs stop the mechanism that pumps acid into the stomach, helping to relieve peptic ulcer pain and promote healing.
A health care provider may prescribe people who have Zollinger-Ellison syndrome higher-than-normal doses of PPIs to control the acid production.
Studies show that PPIs may increase the risk of hip, wrist, and spine fractures when a person takes them long term or in high doses, so it's important for people to discuss risks versus benefits with their health care provider.
Can Epilepsy be Prevented?
Many cases of epilepsy can be prevented by wearing seatbelts and bicycle helmets, putting children in car seats, and other measures that prevent head injury and other trauma.
Prescribing medication after first or second seizures or febrile seizures also may help prevent epilepsy in some cases.
Good prenatal care, including treatment of high blood pressure and infections during pregnancy, can prevent brain damage in the developing baby that may lead to epilepsy and other neurological problems later.
Treating cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, infections, and other disorders that can affect the brain during adulthood and aging also may prevent many cases of epilepsy.
Finally, identifying the genes for many neurological disorders can provide opportunities for genetic screening and prenatal diagnosis that may ultimately prevent many cases of epilepsy.

Foods should be cooked long enough and at a high enough temperature to kill the harmful bacteria that cause illnesses.
A meat thermometer should be used to ensure foods are cooked to the appropriate internal temperature: 145 degrees for roasts, steaks, and chops of beef, veal, pork, and lamb, followed by 3 minutes of rest time after the meat is removed from the heat source.
How does bowel control work?
Circular muscles called sphincters close tightly like rubber bands around the anus until stool is ready to be released.
Pelvic floor muscles also help with bowel control.
What are the symptoms?
Dystonia can affect many different parts of the body, and the symptoms are different depending upon the form of dystonia.
Early symptoms may include a foot cramp or a tendency for one foot to turn or drag - either sporadically or after running or walking some distance - or a worsening in handwriting after writing several lines.
In other instances, the neck may turn or pull involuntarily, especially when the person is tired or under stress.
Sometimes both eyes might blink rapidly and uncontrollably; other times, spasms will cause the eyes to close.
Symptoms may also include tremor or difficulties speaking.
In some cases, dystonia can affect only one specific action, while allowing others to occur unimpeded.
For example, a musician may have dystonia when using her hand to play an instrument, but not when using the same hand to type.
The initial symptoms can be very mild and may be noticeable only after prolonged exertion, stress, or fatigue.
Over a period of time, the symptoms may become more noticeable or widespread; sometimes, however, there is little or no progression.
Dystonia typically is not associated with problems thinking or understanding, but depression and anxiety may be present.
What Treatments Are Available?

What is Multi-Infarct Dementia?
Multi-infarct dementia MID is a common cause of memory loss in the elderly.
MID is caused by multiple strokes disruption of blood flow to the brain.
Disruption of blood flow leads to damaged brain tissue.
Some of these strokes may occur without noticeable clinical symptoms.
Doctors refer to these as 'silent strokes.' An individual having a silent stroke may not even know it is happening, but over time, as more areas of the brain are damaged and more small blood vessels are blocked, the symptoms of MID begin to appear.
MID can be diagnosed by an MRI or CT of the brain, along with a neurological examination.
Symptoms include confusion or problems with short-term memory; wandering, or getting lost in familiar places; walking with rapid, shuffling steps; losing bladder or bowel control; laughing or crying inappropriately; having difficulty following instructions; and having problems counting money and making monetary transactions.
MID, which typically begins between the ages of 60 and 75, affects men more often than women.
Because the symptoms of MID are so similar to Alzheimer's disease, it can be difficult for a doctor to make a firm diagnosis.
Since the diseases often occur together, making a single diagnosis of one or the other is even more problematic.

Symptoms occur as episodes, typically lasting a few days to a few weeks.
Episode onset is often abrupt, and may be associated with flu-like symptoms.
Excessive food intake, irritability, childishness, disorientation, hallucinations, and an abnormally uninhibited sex drive may be observed during episodes.
Mood can be depressed as a consequence, but not a cause, of the disorder.
Affected individuals are completely normal between episodes, although they may not be able to remember afterwards everything that happened during the episode.
It may be weeks or more before symptoms reappear.
Symptoms may be related to malfunction of the hypothalamus and thalamus, parts of the brain that govern appetite and sleep.

Agnosia is a rare disorder characterized by an inability to recognize and identify objects or persons.
People with agnosia may have difficulty recognizing the geometric features of an object or face or may be able to perceive the geometric features but not know what the object is used for or whether a face is familiar or not.
Agnosia can be limited to one sensory modality such as vision or hearing.
For example, a person may have difficulty in recognizing an object as a cup or identifying a sound as a cough.
Agnosia can result from strokes, dementia, developmental disorders, or other neurological conditions.
It typically results from damage to specific brain areas in the occipital or parietal lobes of the brain.
People with agnosia may retain their cognitive abilities in other areas.

What causes ALS?
For example, the discovery of certain genetic mutations involved in ALS suggests that changes in the processing of RNA molecules involved with functions including gene regulation and activity may lead to ALS-related motor neuron degeneration.
Other gene mutations implicate defects in protein recycling.
And still others point to possible defects in the structure and shape of motor neurons, as well as increased susceptibility to environmental toxins.
Overall, it is becoming increasingly clear that a number of cellular defects can lead to motor neuron degeneration in ALS.
Can the disorder be prevented?
Folic acid, also called folate, is an important vitamin in the development of a healthy fetus.
Although taking this vitamin cannot guarantee having a healthy baby, it can help.
Recent studies have shown that by adding folic acid to their diets, women of childbearing age significantly reduce the risk of having a child with a neural tube defect, such as spina bifida.
Therefore, it is recommended that all women of childbearing age consume 400 micrograms of folic acid daily.
Foods high in folic acid include dark green vegetables, egg yolks, and some fruits.
Many foods - such as some breakfast cereals, enriched breads, flours, pastas, rice, and other grain products - are now fortified with folic acid.
Many multivitamins contain the recommended dosage of folic acid as well.

What is Rasmussen's Encephalitis?
Rasmussen's encephalitis is a rare, chronic inflammatory neurological disease that usually affects only one hemisphere of the brain.
It usually occurs in children under the age of 10 more rarely in adolescents and adults, and is characterized by frequent and severe seizures, loss of motor skills and speech, paralysis on one side of the body hemiparesis, inflammation of the brain encephalitis, and mental deterioration.
Most individuals with Rasmussen's encephalitis will experience frequent seizures and progressive brain damage in the affected hemisphere of the brain over the course of the first 8 to 12 months, and then enter a phase of permanent, but stable, neurological deficits.
Rasmussen's encephalitis has features of an autoimmune disease in which immune system cells enter the brain and cause inflammation and damage.
Research is ongoing into the causes of this rare disease.
What Is Hemochromatosis?
Hemochromatosis occurs when the body absorbs too much iron from foods and other sources such as vitamins containing iron.
This disease causes extra iron to gradually build up in the body's tissues and organs, a term called iron overload.
If this iron buildup is untreated, it can, over many years, damage the body's organs.
Who is at risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome?
Women are three times more likely than men to develop carpal tunnel syndrome, perhaps because the carpal tunnel itself may be smaller in women than in men.
The dominant hand is usually affected first and produces the most severe pain.

Most individuals with a mucopolysaccharidosis syndrome generally experience a period of normal development followed by a decline in physical and mental function.
Longevity is dependent upon the particular syndrome.
For example, children with a form of mucopolysaccharidosis called Hurler syndrome often die before age 10 from obstructive airway disease, respiratory infections, or cardiac complications.
A child with the type known as Scheie syndrome can live into adulthood, while one with a mild case of the type known as Hunter syndrome may live into his or her 50s or beyond.
What is the prognosis for Prosopagnosia?
Prosopagnosia can be socially crippling.
Individuals with the disorder often have difficulty recognizing family members and close friends.
They often use other ways to identify people, such as relying on voice, clothing, or unique physical attributes, but these are not as effective as recognizing a face.
Children with congenital prosopagnosia are born with the disability and have never had a time when they could recognize faces.
Greater awareness of autism, and the autism spectrum disorders, which involve communication impairments such as prosopagnosia, is likely to make the disorder less overlooked in the future.
What should you expect during Thoracentesis?
Thoracentesis is done at a doctor's office or hospital.

If you have a lot of fluid in your pleural space, the procedure may take up to 45 minutes.
What is Todd's Paralysis?
Todd's paralysis is a neurological condition experienced by individuals with epilepsy, in which a seizure is followed by a brief period of temporary paralysis.
The paralysis may be partial or complete but usually occurs on just one side of the body.
The paralysis can last from half an hour to 36 hours, with an average of 15 hours, at which point it resolves completely.
Todd's paralysis may also affect speech and vision.
Scientists don't know what causes Todd's paralysis.
Current theories propose biological processes in the brain that involve a slow down in either the energy output of neurons or in the motor centers of the brain.
It is important to distinguish Todd's paralysis from a stroke, which it can resemble, because a stroke requires completely different treatment.

CHANGE users have noted how helpful the tool is for:
What Is Celiac Disease?
Celiac disease, sometimes called sprue or celiac sprue, is an inherited intestinal disorder in which the body cannot tolerate gluten.
Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, barley, farina, and bulgur.
When people with celiac disease eat foods containing gluten, their immune systems respond by attacking and damaging the lining of the small intestine.
The small intestine is responsible for absorbing nutrients from food into the bloodstream for the body to use.
When the lining is damaged, so is its ability to absorb these nutrients.
How Can Diabetic Heart Disease Be Prevented?
Taking action to control risk factors can help prevent or delay heart disease in people who have diabetes and in those who don't.

Their parents are educated about the disease and how to manage it.
These initial treatment steps have greatly improved the outcome for children who have sickle cell anemia.
DoesStachybotrys chartarumStachybotrys atra cause acute idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage among infants?
To date, a possible association between acute idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage among infants and Stachybotrys chartarum Stachybotrys atra has not been proved.
Further studies are needed to determine what causes acute idiopathic hemorrhage.
How do I Avoid Portion Size Pitfalls to Help Manage Your Weight?
When eating at many restaurants, it's hard to miss that portion sizes have gotten larger in the last few years.
The trend has also spilled over into the grocery store and vending machines, where a bagel has become a BAGEL and an individual bag of chips can easily feed more than one.
Research shows that people unintentionally consume more calories when faced with larger portions.
This can mean significant excess calorie intake, especially when eating high-calorie foods.
Here are some tips to help you avoid some common portion-size pitfalls.
Can wigs or hair pieces spread lice?
Head lice and their eggs nits soon perish if separated from their human host.
Adult head lice can live only a day or so off the human head without blood for feeding.
Nymphs young head lice can live only for several hours without feeding on a human.
Nits head lice eggs generally die within a week away from their human host and cannot hatch at a temperature lower than that close to the human scalp.
For these reasons, the risk of transmission of head lice from a wig or other hairpiece is extremely small, particularly if the wig or hairpiece has not been worn within the preceding 48 hours by someone who is actively infested with live head lice.

What is PORENCEPHALY?
PORENCEPHALY is an extremely rare disorder of the central nervous system involving a cyst or cavity in a cerebral hemisphere.
Why are people born before 1957 exempt from receiving MMR vaccine?
People born before 1957 lived through several years of epidemic measles before the first measles vaccine was licensed.
As a result, these people are very likely to have had the measles disease.
Surveys suggest that 95% to 98% of those born before 1957 are immune to measles.
Note: The 1957 rule applies only to measles and mumps - it does NOT apply to rubella.
What is Presymptomatic Testing?
There are many complicating factors that reflect the complexity of diagnosing HD.
In a small number of individuals with HD - 1 to 3 percent - no family history of HD can be found.
Some individuals may not be aware of their genetic legacy, or a family member may conceal a genetic disorder from fear of social stigma.
A parent may not want to worry children, scare them, or deter them from marrying.
In other cases, a family member may die of another cause before he or she begins to show signs of HD.
Sometimes, the cause of death for a relative may not be known, or the family is not aware of a relative's death.
Adopted children may not know their genetic heritage, or early symptoms in an individual may be too slight to attract attention.
How Is Back Pain Treated?
Treatment for back pain generally depends on what kind of pain you experience: acute or chronic.
What structures make up the back?
The back is an intricate structure of bones, muscles, and other tissues that form the posterior part of the body's trunk, from the neck to the pelvis.
The centerpiece is the spinal column, which not only supports the upper body's weight but houses and protects the spinal cord - the delicate nervous system structure that carries signals that control the body's movements and convey its sensations.
Stacked on top of one another are more than 30 bones - the vertebrae - that form the spinal column, also known as the spine.
Each of these bones contains a roundish hole that, when stacked in register with all the others, creates a channel that surrounds the spinal cord.
The spinal cord descends from the base of the brain and extends in the adult to just below the rib cage.
Small nerves roots enter and emerge from the spinal cord through spaces between the vertebrae.
Because the bones of the spinal column continue growing long after the spinal cord reaches its full length in early childhood, the nerve roots to the lower back and legs extend many inches down the spinal column before exiting.
This large bundle of nerve roots was dubbed by early anatomists as the cauda equina, or horse's tail.
The spaces between the vertebrae are maintained by round, spongy pads of cartilage called intervertebral discs that allow for flexibility in the lower back and act much like shock absorbers throughout the spinal column to cushion the bones as the body moves.
Bands of tissue known as ligaments and tendons hold the vertebrae in place and attach the muscles to the spinal column.
Are there any treatments?
No cure or specific therapies for ML currently exists.
Therapies are generally geared toward treating symptoms and providing supportive care to the child.
For individuals with corneal clouding, surgery to remove the thin layer over the eye has been shown to reduce the cloudiness in the eye.
However, this improvement may be only temporary.
Physical and occupational therapy may help children with motor delays.
Children with language delays may benefit from speech therapy.
I found mold growing in my home, how do I test the mold?
Generally, it is not necessary to identify the species of mold growing in a residence, and CDC does not recommend routine sampling for molds.
Current evidence indicates that allergies are the type of diseases most often associated with molds.
Since the susceptibility of individuals can vary greatly either because of the amount or type of mold, sampling and culturing are not reliable in determining your health risk.
If you are susceptible to mold and mold is seen or smelled, there is a potential health risk; therefore, no matter what type of mold is present, you should arrange for its removal.
Furthermore, reliable sampling for mold can be expensive, and standards for judging what is and what is not an acceptable or tolerable quantity of mold have not been established.
How do I Deal With Challenges and Setbacks?
Write it down.
Write down what you eat and the amount of physical activity you do each day.
This can help pinpoint problems and ensure that you're getting the proper nutrition and enough physical activity.
Use the form in box 14 of Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH to record your food and physical activity habits.
What is the prognosis for Neurological Complications of Lyme Disease?
Most individuals with Lyme disease respond well to antibiotics and have full recovery.
In a small percentage of individuals, symptoms may continue or recur, requiring additional antibiotic treatment.
Varying degrees of permanent joint or nervous system damage may develop in individuals with late-stage Lyme disease.
What are the types of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease?
There are many forms of CMT disease, including CMT1, CMT2, CMT3, CMT4, and CMTX.
CMT1, caused by abnormalities in the myelin sheath, has three main types.
CMT1A is an autosomal dominant disease that results from a duplication of the gene on chromosome 17 that carries the instructions for producing the peripheral myelin protein-22 PMP-22.
The PMP-22 protein is a critical component of the myelin sheath.
Overexpression of this gene causes the structure and function of the myelin sheath to be abnormal.
Patients experience weakness and atrophy of the muscles of the lower legs beginning in adolescence; later they experience hand weakness and sensory loss.
Interestingly, a different neuropathy distinct from CMT1A called hereditary neuropathy with predisposition to pressure palsy HNPP is caused by a deletion of one of the PMP-22 genes.
In this case, abnormally low levels of the PMP-22 gene result in episodic, recurrent demyelinating neuropathy.
CMT1B is an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in the gene that carries the instructions for manufacturing the myelin protein zero P0, which is another critical component of the myelin sheath.
Most of these mutations are point mutations, meaning a mistake occurs in only one letter of the DNA genetic code.
To date, scientists have identified more than 120 different point mutations in the P0 gene.
As a result of abnormalities in P0, CMT1B produces symptoms similar to those found in CMT1A.
The less common CMT1C, CMT1D, and CMT1E, which also have symptoms similar to those found in CMT1A, are caused by mutations in the LITAF, EGR2, and NEFL genes, respectively.
How are abdominal adhesions and intestinal obstructions treated?
Abdominal adhesions that do not cause symptoms generally do not require treatment.
Surgery is the only way to treat abdominal adhesions that cause pain, intestinal obstruction, or fertility problems.
More surgery, however, carries the risk of additional abdominal adhesions.
People should speak with their health care provider about the best way to treat their abdominal adhesions.

A health care provider will usually order an ultrasound exam to diagnose gallstones.
Other imaging tests may also be used.
What are the signs and symptoms of bleeding in the digestive tract?
A person with acute bleeding may go into shock, which is an emergency condition.
A person in shock may have additional signs and symptoms that may include.
What Is an Asthma Attack?
An asthma attack may include coughing, chest tightness, wheezing, and trouble breathing.
The attack happens in your body's airways, which are the paths that carry air to your lungs.
As the air moves through your lungs, the airways become smaller, like the branches of a tree are smaller than the tree trunk.
During an asthma attack, the sides of the airways in your lungs swell and the airways shrink.
Less air gets in and out of your lungs, and mucous that your body makes clogs up the airways even more.
How Is Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation Treated?
Treatment for disseminated intravascular coagulation DIC depends on its severity and cause.
The main goals of treating DIC are to control bleeding and clotting problems and treat the underlying cause.
What is Spinal muscular atrophy SMA?

How do I Use an Automated External Defibrillator?
If you see a person suddenly collapse and pass out, or if you find a person already unconscious, confirm that the person can't respond.
Shout at and shake the person to make sure he or she isn't sleeping.
What Is Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome?
Usually, blood clotting is a normal bodily process.
Blood clots help seal small cuts or breaks on blood vessel walls.
This prevents you from losing too much blood.
In APS, however, too much blood clotting can block blood flow and damage the body's organs.
What is Swine influenza swine flu?
Swine influenza swine flu is a respiratory disease of pigs caused by type A influenza viruses that regularly cause outbreaks of influenza in pigs.
What Is CDC Doing about Birth Defects?
Preventing birth defects: Although we do not know the cause of most birth defects, the good news is that we know how to prevent some birth defects.
CDC is working to find out how to prevent others.
Scientists study data gathered from our birth defects monitoring systems to learn more.
We know there are things a woman can do before and during pregnancy to increase her chance of having a healthy baby: see a health professional regularly, take 400 mcg of folic acid every day - starting at least one month before getting pregnant, don't drink alcohol, smoke, or use illicit drugs, and get medical conditions like diabetes under control before getting pregnant.
Research suggests that many other important health behaviors may play a role in birth defects prevention.
Learn more about our efforts to prevent birth defects.
What should you expect after a Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant?

They also will tell you who to call and what to do in case of an emergency.
What is Metabolic syndrome?
Metabolic syndrome is a lifelong condition.
What Are the Risks of Cardiac CT?
Cardiac CT scans are painless.
Some people have side effects from the contrast dye that might be used during the scan.
An itchy feeling or a rash may appear after the contrast dye is injected.
Normally, neither side effect lasts for long, so medicine often isn't needed.
What is the prognosis for Hypotonia?
Hypotonia can be a life-long condition.
In some cases, however, muscle tone improves over time.

How can I tell if my child is overweight or obese?
For example, a child who is relatively heavy may have a high BMI for his or her age.
To determine whether the child has excess fat, further assessment would be needed.
Further assessment might include skinfold thickness measurements.
To determine a counseling strategy, assessments of diet, health, and physical activity are needed.
What Are the Causes of Back Pain?
It is important to understand that back pain is a symptom of a medical condition, not a diagnosis itself.
Medical problems that can cause back pain include the following:
What is the prognosis for Cerebral?
The prognosis for persons whose aneurysm has burst is largely dependent on the age and general health of the individual, other pre-existing neurological conditions, location of the aneurysm, extent of bleeding and rebleeding, and time between rupture and medical attention.
It is estimated that about 40 percent of individuals whose aneurysm has ruptured do not survive the first 24 hours; up to another 25 percent die from complications within 6 months.
People who experience subarachnoid hemorrhage may have permanent neurological damage.
Other individuals may recover with little or no neurological deficit.
Delayed complications from a burst aneurysm may include hydrocephalus and vasospasm.
Early diagnosis and treatment are important.
What other conditions are associated with IBS?
People with IBS often suffer from other GI and non-GI conditions.
GI conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD and dyspepsia are more common in people with IBS than the general population.
GERD is a condition in which stomach contents flow back up into the esophagus - the organ that connects the mouth to the stomach - because the muscle between the esophagus and the stomach is weak or relaxes when it should not.
Dyspepsia, or indigestion, is upper abdominal discomfort that often occurs after eating.
Dyspepsia may be accompanied by fullness, bloating, nausea, or other GI symptoms.
Read more in Gastroesophageal Reflux GER and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease GERD in Adults and Indigestion.

What is A peptic ulcer?
A peptic ulcer is a sore in the lining of your stomach or duodenum*.
What is Tetanus lockjaw?
Tetanus lockjaw is a serious disease that causes painful tightening of the muscles, usually all over the body.
What is the prognosis for Myopathy?
The prognosis for individuals with a myopathy varies.
Some individuals have a normal life span and little or no disability.
For others, however, the disorder may be progressive, severely disabling, life-threatening, or fatal.
What is the prognosis for Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease?
About 90 percent of patients die within 1 year.
In the early stages of disease, patients may have failing memory, behavioral changes, lack of coordination and visual disturbances.
As the illness progresses, mental deterioration becomes pronounced and involuntary movements, blindness, weakness of extremities, and coma may occur.
Is there any treatment for Ohtahara Syndrome?
Antiepileptic drugs are used to control seizures, but are unfortunately not usually very effective for this disorder.
Corticosteroids are occasionally helpful.
In cases where there is a focal brain lesion damage contained to one area of the brain surgery may be beneficial.
Other therapies are symptomatic and supportive.
Why Do People Have Hip Replacement Surgery?
For the majority of people who have hip replacement surgery, the procedure results in:
How Is Vasculitis Treated?

Talk with your doctor, nurse, or other health care professional about your bone health.
Use this checklist to start your discussion.
What research is being done for Multiple System Atrophy?
The NINDS supports research about MSA through grants to major medical institutions across the country.
In 2007, the NINDS sponsored a consensus conference that brought together experts from around the world to review and update the diagnostic criteria for MSA.
These new diagnostic guidelines are helping doctors make quicker and more accurate diagnoses of MSA.
A great deal of research is ongoing to learn why synuclein buildup occurs in MSA and Parkinson's disease, and how to prevent it.
My child does not have diarrhea, but was recently diagnosed as havingGiardia infection.
My health care provider says treatment is not necessary.
Is this correct?
Your child does not usually need treatment if he or she has no symptoms.
However, there are a few exceptions.
If your child does not have diarrhea, but does have other symptoms such as nausea or upset stomach, tiredness, weight loss, or a lack of hunger, you and your health care provider may need to think about treatment.
The same is true if many family members are ill, or if a family member is pregnant and unable to take the most effective medications to treat Giardia.
Contact your health care provider for specific treatment recommendations.
How is Ibuprofen also used?
Ibuprofen also is used to close PDAs in premature infants.
How common is constipation and who is affected most?
Many women get constipated during pregnancy or after giving birth.
Constipation is also common after surgery.
People taking medicines to treat depression or to relieve pain from things such as a broken bone, a pulled tooth, or back pain may have constipation.
What about mosquito control in my town/county?
Integrated mosquito management helps reduce the number of mosquitoes, especially those that can carry disease.
This is a crucial part of reducing the risk to humans.
Mosquito control won't get rid of every last mosquito, but combined with repellent use one can markedly reduce the chances of getting bitten.
Ask local officials about starting mosquito control in your city or county if it doesn't exist already.
What is Hemolytic anemia?
Hemolytic anemia is a condition in which red blood cells are destroyed faster than the body can replace them.
What is A healthy diet?
A healthy diet is an important part of a healthy lifestyle.
How is the Cause of Stroke Determined?
Physicians have several diagnostic techniques and imaging tools to help diagnose the cause of stroke quickly and accurately.
The first step in diagnosis is a short neurological examination.
When a possible stroke patient arrives at a hospital, a health care professional, usually a doctor or nurse, will ask the patient or a companion what happened and when the symptoms began.
Blood tests, an electrocardiogram, and a brain scan, such CT or MRI, will often be done.
One test that helps doctors judge the severity of a stroke is the standardized NIH Stroke Scale, developed by the NINDS.
Health care professionals use the NIH Stroke Scale to measure a patient's neurological deficits by asking the patient to answer questions and to perform several physical and mental tests.
Other scales include the Glasgow Coma Scale, the Hunt and Hess Scale, the Modified Rankin Scale, and the Barthel Index.
What Causes Raynaud's?
In primary Raynaud's also called Raynaud's disease, the cause isn't known.
Primary Raynaud's is more common and tends to be less severe than secondary Raynaud's.

How Is Narcolepsy Diagnosed?
It can take as long as 10 to 15 years after the first symptoms appear before narcolepsy is recognized and diagnosed.
This is because narcolepsy is fairly rare.
Also, many narcolepsy symptoms are like symptoms of other illnesses, such as infections, depression, and sleep disorders.
What is Neuropathic pain?
Neuropathic pain is a type of pain that can result from injury to nerves, either in the peripheral or central nervous system see The Nervous Systems in the Appendix.
How is carpal tunnel syndrome diagnosed?
Physicians can use specific tests to try to produce the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome.
In the Tinel test, the doctor taps on or presses on the median nerve in the patient's wrist.
The test is positive when tingling in the fingers or a resultant shock-like sensation occurs.
The Phalen, or wrist-flexion, test involves having the patient hold his or her forearms upright by pointing the fingers down and pressing the backs of the hands together.
The presence of carpal tunnel syndrome is suggested if one or more symptoms, such as tingling or increasing numbness, is felt in the fingers within 1 minute.
Doctors may also ask patients to try to make a movement that brings on symptoms.
What causes myasthenia gravis?
Myasthenia gravis is caused by a defect in the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles.
It occurs when normal communication between the nerve and muscle is interrupted at the neuromuscular junction - the place where nerve cells connect with the muscles they control.
Normally when impulses travel down the nerve, the nerve endings release a neurotransmitter substance called acetylcholine.
Acetylcholine travels from the neuromuscular junction and binds to acetylcholine receptors which are activated and generate a muscle contraction.
What is Clinical staging based on?
Clinical staging is based on whether the tumor has spread to regional lymph nodes or distant sites.
Why Might Some Adults Need Vaccines?
Some adults incorrectly assume that the vaccines they received as children will protect them for the rest of their lives.
Generally this is true, except that:
What was CDC's role in responding to the anthrax attacks?
National surveillance; epidemiologic investigations in collaboration with state and local health departments; support for state public health labs through the Laboratory Response Network LRN; laboratory diagnostic support through the Rapid Response and Advanced Technology Laboratory RRAT Lab, Anthrax Laboratory, and Pathology Laboratory for case confirmation; clinical consultation; professional and public education; advice on postexposure prophylaxis; deployment of antimicrobial agents and supplies through the Vendor Managed Inventory of the NPS; consultation on environmental decontamination; development of treatment recommendations.
What is Sleep often?
Sleep often is the first thing that busy people squeeze out of their schedules.
What is The CT scanner?
The CT scanner is a large machine that has a hollow, circular tube in the center.
How Is Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Treated?
Augmentation og-men-TA-shun therapy is a treatment used only for people who have AAT-related lung diseases.
This therapy involves getting infusions of the AAT protein.
The infusions raise the level of the protein in your blood and lungs.
How Is Fibrous Dysplasia Treated?
There is no cure for fibrous dysplasia.
Like most medical conditions, one treats the symptoms or problems as they arise.
Fractures often require surgery, but can sometimes be treated with just a cast.
Surgeries are recommended if a fracture is likely to occur, or in an effort to correct the shape of the bone.
Surgery may also be indicated to relieve bone pain.
Medications known as bisphosphonates - approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of other bone diseases - have been shown to reduce pain associated with the disease.
Bone-healthy strategies such as physical activity with physician approval, and adequate calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D intake are also important.
What is the prognosis for Meralgia Paresthetica?
Meralgia paresthetica usually has a good prognosis.
In most cases, meralgia paresthetica will improve with conservative treatment or may even spontaneously resolve.
Surgical intervention is not always fully successful.
What is Congenital myasthenia?
Congenital myasthenia is an inherited genetic disorder.
What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Respiratory Failure?
A low oxygen level in the blood can cause shortness of breath and air hunger feeling like you can't breathe in enough air.
If the level of oxygen is very low, it also can cause a bluish color on the skin, lips, and fingernails.
A high carbon dioxide level can cause rapid breathing and confusion.
How is ALS diagnosed?
Since ALS symptoms in the early stages of the disease can be similar to those of a wide variety of other, more treatable diseases or disorders, appropriate tests must be conducted to exclude the possibility of other conditions.
One of these tests is electromyography EMG, a special recording technique that detects electrical activity in muscles.
Certain EMG findings can support the diagnosis of ALS.
Another common test is a nerve conduction study NCS, which measures electrical energy by assessing the nerve's ability to send a signal.
Specific abnormalities in the NCS and EMG may suggest, for example, that the individual has a form of peripheral neuropathy damage to peripheral nerves or myopathy muscle disease rather than ALS.
The physician may order magnetic resonance imaging MRI, a noninvasive procedure that uses a magnetic field and radio waves to take detailed images of the brain and spinal cord.
Standard MRI scans are normal in people with ALS.
However, they can reveal evidence of other problems that may be causing the symptoms, such as a spinal cord tumor, a herniated disk in the neck that compresses the spinal cord, syringomyelia a cyst in the spinal cord, or cervical spondylosis abnormal wear affecting the spine in the neck.
What is The Tracking Network?
The Tracking Network is a tool that can help us estimate how solving one problem can help solve the other.
What research is being done for Tabes Dorsalis?
The NINDS supports and conducts research on neurodegenerative disorders, such as tabes dorsalis, in an effort to find ways to prevent, treat, and, ultimately, cure these disorders.

COFS is a fatal disease.
Most children do not live beyond five years.
What is Pulmonary circulation?
Pulmonary circulation is the movement of blood from the heart to the lungs and back to the heart again.
What is Klippel-Feil Syndrome?
Klippel-Feil Syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by the congenital fusion of any 2 of the 7 cervical neck vertebrae.
What is the prognosis for Schilder's Disease?
As with multiple sclerosis, the course and prognosis of Schilder's disease are unpredictable.
For some individuals the disorder is progressive with a steady, unremitting course.
Others may experience significant improvement and even remission.
In some cases, Schilder's disease is fatal.
What are the health consequences of AVMs?
The greatest potential danger posed by AVMs is hemorrhage.
Researchers believe that each year between 2 and 4 percent of all AVMs hemorrhage.
Most episodes of bleeding remain undetected at the time they occur because they are not severe enough to cause significant neurological damage.
But massive, even fatal, bleeding episodes do occur.
The present state of knowledge does not permit doctors to predict whether or not any particular person with an AVM will suffer an extensive hemorrhage.
The lesions can remain stable or can suddenly begin to grow.
In a few cases, they have been observed to regress spontaneously.
Whenever an AVM is detected, the individual should be carefully and consistently monitored for any signs of instability that may indicate an increased risk of hemorrhage.
What research is being done for Complex Regional Pain Syndrome?
The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health NIH conduct research relating to CRPS in laboratories at the NIH and also support additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country.
NINDS-supported scientists are studying new approaches to treat CRPS and intervene more aggressively after traumatic injury to lower the chances of developing the disorder.
What is Iron overload?
Iron overload is the accumulation of excess iron in body tissues.
How does a person prepare for ERCP?
Patients should tell their health care provider about all health conditions they have, especially heart and lung problems, diabetes, and allergies.
Patients should also tell their health care provider about all medications they take.
Patients may be asked to temporarily stop taking medications that affect blood clotting or interact with sedatives, which are usually given during ERCP to help patients relax and stay comfortable.
What research shows that seasonal flu vaccine is safe for unborn babies?
Studies of several thousand pregnant women in scientific literature have assessed the safety of using the flu vaccine during pregnancy.
These studies have shown no evidence of harm to pregnant women, to the unborn child or fetus or to newborns of vaccinated women.
In addition, the Food and Drug Administration's FDA and CDC's routine monitoring of adverse events has not raised safety concerns.
What is Intestinal pseudo-obstruction?
Intestinal pseudo-obstruction is a rare condition with symptoms that resemble those caused by a blockage, or obstruction, of the intestines, also called the bowel.
When is a liver transplant considered for primary biliary cirrhosis?
A health care provider may consider a liver transplant when cirrhosis leads to liver failure or treatment for complications is ineffective.
Liver transplantation is surgery to remove a diseased or an injured liver and replace it with a healthy liver or part of a liver from another person, called a donor.
How can hepatitis D be prevented?
People not already infected with hepatitis B should receive the hepatitis B vaccine.
Other preventive measures include avoiding exposure to infected blood, contaminated needles, and an infected person's personal items such as toothbrushes, razors, and nail clippers.
Is BMI interpreted the same way for children and teens as it is for adults?
Although the BMI number is calculated the same way for children and adults, the criteria used to interpret the meaning of the BMI number for children and teens are different from those used for adults.
For children and teens, BMI age- and sex-specific percentiles are used for two reasons:
What treatments are available?
Doctors prescribe central nervous system alerting agents such as modafinil and amphetamine-like stimulants such as methylphenidate to alleviate EDS and reduce the incidence of sleep attacks.
For most people these medications are generally quite effective at reducing daytime drowsiness and improving levels of alertness.
However, use of these medications may be associated with several undesirable side effects and must be carefully monitored.
Common side effects include irritability and nervousness, shakiness, disturbances in heart rhythm, stomach upset, nighttime sleep disruption, and anorexia.
Individuals may also develop tolerance with long-term use, leading to the need for increased dosages to maintain effectiveness.
In addition, doctors should be careful when prescribing these drugs and people should be careful using them because the potential for abuse is high with any amphetamine.
How Is Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome Diagnosed?
Obesity hypoventilation syndrome OHS is diagnosed based on your medical history, signs and symptoms, and test results.
What is Respiratory failure?
Respiratory failure is a condition in which not enough oxygen passes from your lungs into your blood.
The real question was, 'Will this hurt someone?
Not many people can bring up the risks from inhaling anthrax spores, microwave popcorn flavoring and nano particulates in the same conversation.
CDC's Ann Hubbs, DVM, Ph.D., is that person.
Hubbs was selected to respond to the 2001 intentional release of anthrax, in part, because she had a unique professional background.
How is Parkinson's Disease Diagnosed?
There are currently no blood or laboratory tests that diagnose sporadic PD.
Therefore the diagnosis is based on medical history and a neurological examination.
In some cases PD can be difficult to diagnose accurately early on in the course of the disease.
Early signs and symptoms of PD may sometimes be dismissed as the effects of normal aging.
Doctors may sometimes request brain scans or laboratory tests in order to rule out other disorders.
However, CT and MRI brain scans of people with PD usually appear normal.

Q.
What about flu vaccines for pigs?
A.
Flu vaccines for pigs can help, but are not 100% effective.
Sometimes the vaccine used may not protect against the virus or viruses circulating.
In addition, current vaccines may not be effective in young pigs due to interference from antibodies received from the sow.
Generally, protection of young pigs is achieved by vaccinating sows; however, those maternal antibodies are not fully protective for the young pig and decrease by the time they are 10 to 13 weeks old or sooner.
Producers may vaccinate their animals after maternal antibodies decrease.
What are the Different Kinds of Cephalic Disorders?
SCHIZENCEPHALY is a rare developmental disorder characterized by abnormal slits, or clefts, in the cerebral hemispheres.
Schizencephaly is a form of porencephaly.
Individuals with clefts in both hemispheres, or bilateral clefts, are often developmentally delayed and have delayed speech and language skills and corticospinal dysfunction.
Individuals with smaller, unilateral clefts clefts in one hemisphere may be weak on one side of the body and may have average or near-average intelligence.
Patients with schizencephaly may also have varying degrees of microcephaly, mental retardation, hemiparesis weakness or paralysis affecting one side of the body, or quadriparesis weakness or paralysis affecting all four extremities, and may have reduced muscle tone hypotonia.
Most patients have seizures and some may have hydrocephalus.

The majority of individuals with TOS will improve with exercise and physical therapy.
Vascular TOS, and true neurogenic TOS often require surgery to relieve pressure on the affected vessel or nerve.
How Does Genetic Counseling Help?
People seek genetic counseling to make better decisions about their lives and families.
Because genetic counselors understand how genetic disorders are passed on through families, they can help couples estimate the risks of having children with genetic diseases.
They can also tell parents about tests to determine if they are carrying certain altered genes, tests for newborns who may have inherited certain altered genes, and tests that can be done in early pregnancy to determine if a fetus either carries an altered copy of a gene or is affected with a disorder.
The information derived from all these studies can facilitate family planning.

How does Measle Spread?
People in the United States still get measles, but it's not very common.
That's because most people in this country are protected against measles through vaccination.
However, since measles is still common in parts of Europe, Asia, the Pacific, and Africa, measles is brought into the United States by people who get infected while they are abroad.
How do I Read a Food Label for Calcium?
The food label, called Nutrition Facts, shows you how much one serving of that food contributes to the total amount of calcium, as well as other nutrients, you need every day.
This is expressed as a percentage of the daily value %DV of calcium that is recommended.
For labeling purposes, this is based on the daily calcium recommendation of 1,000 milligrams for people 19 to 50 years old.
Since children and teens 9 to 18 years old require more calcium, their %DV target is higher, as indicated below:

Digestion is important for breaking down food into nutrients, which the body uses for energy, growth, and cell repair.
Food and drink must be changed into smaller molecules of nutrients before the blood absorbs them and carries them to cells throughout the body.
The body breaks down nutrients from food and drink into carbohydrates, protein, fats, and vitamins.
How are the mucopolysaccharidoses diagnosed?
Clinical examination and urine tests excess mucopolysaccharides are excreted in the urine are the first steps in the diagnosis of an MPS disease.
Enzyme assays testing a variety of cells or blood in culture for enzyme deficiency are also used to provide definitive diagnosis of one of the mucopolysaccharidoses.
Prenatal diagnosis using amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling can verify if a fetus is affected with the disorder.
Genetic counseling can help parents who have a family history of the mucopolysaccharidoses determine if they are carrying the mutated gene that causes the disorders.
Is there any treatment for Iniencephaly?
There is no standard treatment for iniencephaly since most infants rarely live longer than a few hours.
Medicine is based more on prevention using supplementation with folic acid.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that mothers can reduce the risk of neural tube birth defects such as iniencephaly by up to 70 percent with daily supplements of at least 4 mg of folic acid.
Pregnant women should avoid taking antiepileptic drugs, diuretics, antihistamines, and sulfa drugs, which have been shown to be associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects.
Maternal obesity and diabetes are also known to increase the risk for these disorders.

What are Pituitary Tumors?
The pituitary is a small, bean-sized gland that is below the hypothalamus, a structure at the base of the brain, by a thread-like stalk that contains both blood vessels and nerves.
It controls a system of hormones in the body that regulate growth, metabolism, the stress response, and functions of the sex organs via the thyroid gland, adrenal gland, ovaries, and testes.
A pituitary tumor is an abnormal growth of cells within the pituitary gland.
Most pituitary tumors are benign, which means they are non-cancerous, grow slowly and do not spread to other parts of the body; however they can make the pituitary gland produce either too many or too few hormones, which can cause problems in the body.
Tumors that make hormones are called functioning tumors, and they can cause a wide array of symptoms depending upon the hormone affected.
Tumors that don't make hormones are called non-functioning tumors.
Their symptoms are directly related to their growth in size and include headaches, vision problems, nausea, and vomiting.
Diseases related to hormone abnormalities include Cushing's disease, in which fat builds up in the face, back and chest, and the arms and legs become very thin; and acromegaly, a condition in which the hands, feet, and face are larger than normal.
Pituitary hormones that impact the sex hormones, such as estrogen and testosterone, can make a woman produce breast milk even though she is not pregnant or nursing, or cause a man to lose his sex drive or lower his sperm count.
Pituitary tumors often go undiagnosed because their symptoms resemble those of so many other more common diseases.

What research is being done for Guillain-Barre?
Scientists are concentrating on finding new treatments and refining existing ones.
Scientists are also looking at the workings of the immune system to find which cells are responsible for beginning and carrying out the attack on the nervous system.
The fact that so many cases of Guillain-Barre begin after a viral or bacterial infection suggests that certain characteristics of some viruses and bacteria may activate the immune system inappropriately.
Investigators are searching for those characteristics.
Certain proteins or peptides in viruses and bacteria may be the same as those found in myelin, and the generation of antibodies to neutralize the invading viruses or bacteria could trigger the attack on the myelin sheath.
As noted previously, neurological scientists, immunologists, virologists, and pharmacologists are all working collaboratively to learn how to prevent this disorder and to make better therapies available when it strikes.
What are Repetitive Motion Disorders?
Repetitive motion disorders RMDs are a family of muscular conditions that result from repeated motions performed in the course of normal work or daily activities.
RMDs include carpal tunnel syndrome, bursitis, tendonitis, epicondylitis, ganglion cyst, tenosynovitis, and trigger finger.
RMDs are caused by too many uninterrupted repetitions of an activity or motion, unnatural or awkward motions such as twisting the arm or wrist, overexertion, incorrect posture, or muscle fatigue.
RMDs occur most commonly in the hands, wrists, elbows, and shoulders, but can also happen in the neck, back, hips, knees, feet, legs, and ankles.
The disorders are characterized by pain, tingling, numbness, visible swelling or redness of the affected area, and the loss of flexibility and strength.
For some individuals, there may be no visible sign of injury, although they may find it hard to perform easy tasks Over time, RMDs can cause temporary or permanent damage to the soft tissues in the body -- such as the muscles, nerves, tendons, and ligaments - and compression of nerves or tissue.
Generally, RMDs affect individuals who perform repetitive tasks such as assembly line work, meatpacking, sewing, playing musical instruments, and computer work.
The disorders may also affect individuals who engage in activities such as carpentry, gardening, and tennis.
What is the GI tract?
The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus - the opening through which stool leaves the body.
Food is digested by the movement of muscles in the GI tract, along with the release of hormones and enzymes.
Organs that make up the GI tract are the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine - which includes the appendix, cecum, colon, and rectum - and anus.
The intestines are sometimes called the bowel.
The last part of the GI tract - called the lower GI tract - consists of the large intestine and anus.

What is the prognosis for Brachial Plexus Injuries?
The site and type of brachial plexus injury determines the prognosis.
For avulsion and rupture injuries, there is no potential for recovery unless surgical reconnection is made in a timely manner.
The potential for recovery varies for neuroma and neuropraxia injuries.
Most individuals with neuropraxia injuries recover spontaneously with a 90-100% return of function.
Is diverticular disease serious?
Most people with the disease do not have serious problems, but some people have severe symptoms.
Diverticulitis can attack suddenly and cause.
What are the different types of mucolipidoses?
Symptoms of ML I are either present at birth or develop within the first year of life.
In many infants with ML I, excessive swelling throughout the body is noted at birth.
These infants are often born with coarse facial features, such as a flat nasal bridge, puffy eyelids, enlargement of the gums, and excessive tongue size macroglossia.
Many infants with ML I are also born with skeletal malformations such as hip dislocation.
Infants often develop sudden involuntary muscle contractions called myoclonus and have red spots in their eyes called cherry-red macules.
They are often unable to coordinate voluntary movement called ataxia.
Tremors, impaired vision, and seizures also occur in children with ML I.
Tests reveal abnormal enlargement of the liver and spleen and extreme abdominal swelling.
Infants with ML I generally lack muscle tone hypotonia and have mental retardation that is either initially or progressively severe.
Many patients suffer from failure to thrive and from recurrent respiratory infections.
Most infants with ML I die before the age of 1 year.

However, some risk factors may affect women differently than men.
For example, diabetes raises the risk of CHD more in women.
Also, some risk factors, such as birth control pills and menopause, only affect women.
What is a BMI percentile?
After BMI is calculated for children and teens, the BMI number is plotted on the CDC BMI-for-age growth charts for either girls or boys to obtain a percentile ranking.
Percentiles are the most commonly used indicator to assess the size and growth patterns of individual children in the United States.
The percentile indicates the relative position of the child's BMI number among children of the same sex and age.
The growth charts show the weight status categories used with children and teens underweight, healthy weight, overweight, and obese.
How Can You Prevent Type 2 Diabetes?
If you have prediabetes or have a higher risk for type 2 diabetes based on the risk factors listed above, you also can reduce your risk by participating in a lifestyle change program that offers advice on healthy eating, physical activity and coping skills in a structured group setting.
The National Diabetes Prevention Program, managed by CDC, is working with community-based organizations and insurers to bring proven lifestyle change programs to communities across America.
You can find information on program locations from CDC's list of recognized programs and from YMCA of the USA.
How is the Disease Treated?
At present, there is no cure for PD, but medications or surgery can often provide improvement in the motor symptoms.
What is Osteoporosis?
Osteoporosis is a condition in which the bones become less dense and more likely to fracture.
Who Needs Stress Testing?
Imaging stress tests, especially, can show whether you have coronary heart disease CHD or a heart valve problem.
Heart valves are like doors; they open and shut to let blood flow between the heart's chambers and into the heart's arteries.
So, like CHD, faulty heart valves can limit the amount of blood reaching your heart..
What is genetic counseling?
Genetic counseling is when a trained health professional talks with you about your family health history.
Some diseases, such as breast and ovarian cancer, can run in families.
Genetic counseling can help you decide whether to get genetic tests.
What is Huntington's Disease?
Huntington's disease HD results from genetically programmed degeneration of brain cells, called neurons, in certain areas of the brain.
This degeneration causes uncontrolled movements, loss of intellectual faculties, and emotional disturbance.
HD is a familial disease, passed from parent to child through a mutation in the normal gene.
Each child of an HD parent has a 50-50 chance of inheriting the HD gene.
If a child does not inherit the HD gene, he or she will not develop the disease and cannot pass it to subsequent generations.
A person who inherits the HD gene will sooner or later develop the disease.
Whether one child inherits the gene has no bearing on whether others will or will not inherit the gene.
Some early symptoms of HD are mood swings, depression, irritability or trouble driving, learning new things, remembering a fact, or making a decision.
As the disease progresses, concentration on intellectual tasks becomes increasingly difficult and the patient may have difficulty feeding himself or herself and swallowing.
The rate of disease progression and the age of onset vary from person to person.
A genetic test, coupled with a complete medical history and neurological and laboratory tests, helps physicians diagnose HD.
Presymptomic testing is available for individuals who are at risk for carrying the HD gene.
In 1 to 3 percent of individuals with HD, no family history of HD can be found.
What research is being done for Progressive?
In addition, there is a great deal of ongoing research on Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases at the National Institutes of Health and at university medical centers throughout the country.
Better understanding of those common related disorders will go a long way toward solving the problem of PSP, just as studying PSP may help shed light on Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.
What is Giant Axonal Neuropathy?
Giant axonal neuropathy GAN is a rare inherited genetic disorder that affects both the central and peripheral nervous systems.
The majority of children with GAN will begin to show symptoms of the disease sometime before five years of age.
Signs of GAN usually begin in the peripheral nervous system, which controls movement and sensation in the arms, legs, and other parts of the body.
The typical symptoms of GAN are clumsiness and muscle weakness that progresses from a 'waddling gait' to a pronounced difficulty in walking.
Additional symptoms include numbness or lack of feeling in the arms and legs, seizures, nystagmus rapid back and forth movement of the eyes, and mental retardation.
A characteristic sign of the disease is dull, tightly curled hair that is markedly different from the parents' in color and texture.
How does much folic acid a woman need?
400 micrograms mcg every day.
How is Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease treated?
Many CMT patients require ankle braces and other orthopedic devices to maintain everyday mobility and prevent injury.
Ankle braces can help prevent ankle sprains by providing support and stability during activities such as walking or climbing stairs.
High-top shoes or boots can also provide support for weak ankles.
Thumb splints can help with hand weakness and loss of fine motor skills.
Assistive devices should be used before disability sets in because the devices may prevent muscle strain and reduce muscle weakening.
Some individuals with CMT may decide to have orthopedic surgery to reverse foot and joint deformities.
What research is being done for Friedreich's Ataxia?
Studies have revealed that frataxin, a protein that should normally be present in the nervous system, the heart, and the pancreas, is severely reduced in patients with Friedreich's ataxia.
Studies have shown that patients have abnormally high levels of iron in their heart tissue.
It is believed that the nervous system, heart, and pancreas may be particularly susceptible to damage from free radicals produced when the excess iron reacts with oxygen because once certain cells in these tissues are destroyed by free radicals they cannot be replaced.
Nerve and muscle cells also have metabolic needs that may make them particularly vulnerable to free radical damage.
The discovery of the genetic mutation that causes Friedreich's ataxia has added new impetus to research efforts on this disease.
What is Alcoholism?
Alcoholism is the second most common cause of cirrhosis in the United States.
How Will the Doctor Know If the Drug I Take Is Working?
Your doctor will probably monitor your progress using two tests: an x ray of your bones and a blood test to measure the level of a chemical called serum alkaline phosphatase SAP in your blood.
The x rays will show your doctor pictures of how your bones are healing.
A decrease in the amount of SAP in your blood will tell your doctor that the disease is less active and you are getting better.

What causes primary biliary cirrhosis?
The causes of primary biliary cirrhosis are unknown.
Most research suggests it is an autoimmune disease.
The immune system protects people from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances.
An autoimmune disease is a disorder in which the body's immune system attacks the body's own cells and organs.
In primary biliary cirrhosis, the immune system attacks the small bile ducts in the liver.
What are the types of lipid storage disease?
Gaucher disease has three common clinical subtypes.
Type 1 or nonneuropathic type is the most common form of the disease.
It occurs most often among persons of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage.
Symptoms may begin early in life or in adulthood and include enlarged liver and grossly enlarged spleen, which can rupture and cause additional complications.
Skeletal weakness and bone disease may be extensive.
The brain is not affected, but there may be lung and, rarely, kidney impairment.
Patients in this group usually bruise easily due to low blood platelets and experience fatigue due to anemia.
Depending on disease onset and severity, type 1 patients may live well into adulthood.
Many patients have a mild form of the disease or may not show any symptoms.
Type 2 or acute infantile neuropathic Gaucher disease typically begins within 3 months of birth.
Symptoms include an enlarged liver and spleen, abnormal eye movement, extensive and progressive brain damage, spasticity, seizures, limb rigidity, and a poor ability to suck and swallow.
Affected children usually die before age 2.
Type 3 the chronic neuronopathic form can begin at any time in childhood or even in adulthood.
It is characterized by slowly progressive but milder neurologic symptoms compared to the acute or Type 2 Gaucher disease.
Major symptoms include an enlarged spleen and/or liver, seizures, poor coordination, skeletal irregularities, eye movement disorders, blood disorders including anemia, and respiratory problems.
Patients often live to their early teen years and, in some cases, into adulthood.
What is A BMI of less than 25?
A BMI of less than 25 is the goal for preventing and treating CHD.
What is the prognosis for Hypertonia?
The prognosis depends upon the severity of the hypertonia and its cause.
In some cases, such as cerebral palsy, the hypertonia may not change over the course of a lifetime.
in other cases, the hypertonia may worsen along with the underlying disease If the hypertonia is mild, it has little or no effect on a person's health.
If there is moderate hypertonia, falls or joint contractures may have an impact on a person's health and safety.
If the hypertonia is so severe that is caused immobility, potential consequences include increased bone fragility and fracture, infection, bed sores, and pneumonia.
Is there any treatment for Glossopharyngeal Neuralgia?
Most doctors will attempt to treat the pain first with drugs.
Some individuals respond well to anticonvulsant drugs, such as carbamazepine and gabapentin.
Surgical options, including nerve resection, tractotomy, or microvascular decompression, should be considered when individuals either don't respond to, or stop responding to, drug therapy.
Surgery is usually successful at ending the cycles of pain, although there may be some sensory loss in the mouth, throat, or tongue.
What is A liver biopsy?
A liver biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of liver tissue for examination with a microscope for signs of damage or disease.
What Are the Signs and Symptoms of an Aneurysm?
The signs and symptoms of an aortic aneurysm depend on the type and location of the aneurysm.
Signs and symptoms also depend on whether the aneurysm has ruptured burst or is affecting other parts of the body.
What is the prognosis for Shaken Baby Syndrome?
In comparison with accidental traumatic brain injury in infants, shaken baby injuries have a much worse prognosis.
Damage to the retina of the eye can cause blindness.
The majority of infants who survive severe shaking will have some form of neurological or mental disability, such as cerebral palsy or mental retardation, which may not be fully apparent before 6 years of age.
Children with shaken baby syndrome may require lifelong medical care.
What causes COPD?
In the United States, tobacco smoke is a key factor in the development and progression of COPD, although exposure to air pollutants in the home and workplace, genetic factors, and respiratory infections also play a role.
In the developing world, indoor air quality is thought to play a larger role in the development and progression of COPD than it does in the United States.
How long has canine influenza been around?
The H3N8 equine influenza virus has been known to exist in horses for more than 40 years.
In 2004, however, cases of an unknown respiratory illness in dogs initially greyhounds were reported.
An investigation showed that this respiratory illness was caused by the equine influenza A H3N8 virus.
Scientists believe that this virus jumped species from horses to dogs and has now adapted to cause illness in dogs and spread efficiently among dogs.
This is now considered a new dog-specific lineage of H3N8.
In September of 2005, this virus was identified by experts as 'a newly emerging pathogen in the dog population' in the United States.
What is Deep brain stimulation DBS?
Deep brain stimulation DBS is a surgical procedure used to treat several disabling neurological symptoms - most commonly the debilitating motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease PD, such as tremor, rigidity, stiffness, slowed movement, and walking problems.

People who have small airways in their noses, throats, or mouths are more likely to have sleep apnea.
Small airways might be due to the shape of these structures or allergies or other conditions that cause congestion.
Is there any treatment for Neuroacanthocytosis?
There are currently no treatments to prevent or slow the progression of neuroacanthocytosis and treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
Medications that block dopamine, such as some of the antipsychotics, may decrease the involuntary movements.
Botulinum toxin injections usually improve symptoms of dystonia.
A feeding tube may be needed for individuals with feeding difficulties to maintain proper nutrition.
Seizures may be treated with a variety of anticonvulsants, and antidepressants may also be appropriate for some individuals.
Speech, occupational, and physical therapy may also be beneficial.
What Is the Prognosis for People Who Have Paget's Disease?
Paget's disease is rarely fatal.
For most people with the disorder, the prognosis is good, particularly if they begin treatment before major changes have occurred in the affected bones.
Because early diagnosis and treatment is important to minimize complications, doctors may recommend that family members of people with Paget's disease who face an increased risk of the disorder themselves have an alkaline phosphatase blood test every 2 to 3 years beginning around age 40.
If the level is elevated, suggesting possible Paget's disease, bone scans or x rays may be used to verify the diagnosis, so that treatment can begin early in the disease process.
Although treatment is effective at controlling symptoms and minimizing the risk of complications, it cannot cure Paget's disease.
A small percentage of people with Paget's disease - perhaps less than 1 in 1,000 - develop a rare type of bone cancer called osteosarcoma, which may be treated with surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy.
What Is Heart Surgery?

How important is a blockage as a cause of stroke?
A blockage of a blood vessel is the most frequent cause of stroke and is responsible for about 80 percent of the approximately 700,000 strokes in the United States each year.
With nearly 150,000 stroke deaths each year, stroke ranks as the fourth leading killer in the United States.
Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States with 2 million of the 3 million Americans who have survived a stroke sustaining some permanent disability.
The overall cost of stroke to the nation is $40 billion a year.
How Are Thalassemias Diagnosed?
Doctors also test the amount of iron in the blood to find out whether the anemia is due to iron deficiency or thalassemia.
Iron-deficiency anemia occurs if the body doesn't have enough iron to make hemoglobin.
The anemia in thalassemia occurs because of a problem with either the alpha globin or beta globin chains of hemoglobin, not because of a lack of iron.
What is Osteoporosis?
Osteoporosis is a disease that causes the skeleton to weaken and the bones to break.
How Is Sickle Cell Anemia Diagnosed?
Doctors also can diagnose sickle cell disease before birth.
This is done using a sample of amniotic fluid or tissue taken from the placenta.
Amniotic fluid is the fluid in the sac surrounding a growing embryo.
The placenta is the organ that attaches the umbilical cord to the mother's womb..

What research is being done for Tremor?
Scientists at the NINDS are evaluating the effectiveness of 1-octanol and octanic acid, substances closely related to alcohol but not intoxicating, for treating essential termor.
Results of two previous NIH studies have shown this agent to be promising as a potential new treatment.
A current study is trying to find out how alcohol is capable of reducing tremor in essential tremor.
NINDS further conducts research to find the genes that causes essential tremor.
What Kind of Care Does the Individual with HD Need?
Impaired coordination may make it difficult for people with HD to feed themselves and to swallow.
As the disease progresses, persons with HD may even choke.
In helping individuals to eat, caregivers should allow plenty of time for meals.
Food can be cut into small pieces, softened, or pureed to ease swallowing and prevent choking.
While some foods may require the addition of thickeners, other foods may need to be thinned.
Dairy products, in particular, tend to increase the secretion of mucus, which in turn increases the risk of choking.
Some individuals may benefit from swallowing therapy, which is especially helpful if started before serious problems arise.
Suction cups for plates, special tableware designed for people with disabilities, and plastic cups with tops can help prevent spilling.
The individual's physician can offer additional advice about diet and about how to handle swallowing difficulties or gastrointestinal problems that might arise, such as incontinence or constipation.
What does you should know:?
Age-related declines in vision and cognitive functioning ability to reason and remember, as well as physical changes such as arthritis or reduced strength, may affect some older adults' driving abilities.
What is the prognosis for Sandhoff Disease?
The prognosis for individuals with Sandhoff disease is poor.
Death usually occurs by age 3 and is generally caused by respiratory infections.
How is Guillain-Barre syndrome diagnosed?
Several disorders have symptoms similar to those found in Guillain-Barre, so doctors examine and question patients carefully before making a diagnosis.
Collectively, the signs and symptoms form a certain pattern that helps doctors differentiate Guillain-Barre from other disorders.
For example, physicians will note whether the symptoms appear on both sides of the body most common in Guillain-Barre and the quickness with which the symptoms appear in other disorders, muscle weakness may progress over months rather than days or weeks.
In Guillain-Barre, reflexes such as knee jerks are usually lost.
Because the signals traveling along the nerve are slower, a nerve conduction velocity NCV test can give a doctor clues to aid the diagnosis.
In Guillain-Barre patients, the cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the spinal cord and brain contains more protein than usual.
Therefore a physician may decide to perform a spinal tap, a procedure in which a needle is inserted into the patient's lower back and a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid from the spinal column is withdrawn for study.
What is the prognosis for Motor?
Prognosis varies depending on the type of MND and the age of onset.
Some MNDs, such as PLS or Kennedy's disease, are not fatal and progress slowly.
People with SMA may appear to be stable for long periods, but improvement should not be expected.
Some MNDs, such as ALS and some forms of SMA, are fatal.
What is Heart failure?
Heart failure is a condition in which your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs.

What biosafety and biosecurity precautions for protecting laboratory workers and the public were in place while this work was being done?
Before the experiments were begun, two tiers of internal CDC approval were conducted: an Institutional Biosafety Committee review and an Animal Care and Use Committee review.
All viruses containing one or more gene segments from the 1918 influenza virus were generated and handled in accordance with biosafety guidelines of the Interim CDC-NIH Recommendation for Raising the Biosafety Level Laboratory Work Involving Noncontemporary Human Influenza Viruses.
Although the 1918 virus was not designated as a select agent at the time this work was performed, all procedures were carried out using the heightened biosecurity elements mandated by CDC's Select Agent program.
The Intra-governmental Select Agents and Toxins Technical Advisory Committee recommended that the reconstructed 1918 influenza virus be added to the list of HHS select agents on September 30, 2005.
Following this recommendation, CDC amended its regulations and designated all reconstructed replication competent forms of the 1918 pandemic influenza virus containing any portion of the coding regions of all eight gene segments reconstructed 1918 Influenza virus as a select agent.
What is Neuromyelitis optica NMO?
Neuromyelitis optica NMO is an uncommon disease syndrome of the central nervous system CNS that affects the optic nerves and spinal cord.

The course of encephalitis lethargica varies depending upon complications or accompanying disorders.
What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation?
With acute DIC, blood clotting in the blood vessels usually occurs first, followed by bleeding.
However, bleeding may be the first obvious sign.
Serious bleeding can occur very quickly after developing acute DIC.
Thus, emergency treatment in a hospital is needed.
Is there any treatment for Microcephaly?
There is no treatment for microcephaly that can return a child's head to a normal size or shape.
Treatment focuses on ways to decrease the impact of the associated deformities and neurological disabilities.
Children with microcephaly and developmental delays are usually evaluated by a pediatric neurologist and followed by a medical management team.
Early childhood intervention programs that involve physical, speech, and occupational therapists help to maximize abilities and minimize dysfunction.
Medications are often used to control seizures, hyperactivity, and neuromuscular symptoms.
Genetic counseling may help families understand the risk for microcephaly in subsequent pregnancies.
What Is the Treatment for Paget's Disease?
The goals of Paget's disease treatment are to control excessive bone breakdown and formation, reduce the risk of complications, and ease bone and joint pain.
In more severe, advanced cases it may also involve repairing fractures, correcting bone deformity, and replacing joints damaged by the disease.
Treatment includes the following:
How is it Diagnosed?
Generally, a physician will examine the individual for upper and lower facial weakness.
In most cases this weakness is limited to one side of the face or occasionally isolated to the forehead, eyelid, or mouth.
A test called electromyography EMG can confirm the presence of nerve damage and determine the severity and the extent of nerve involvement.
Blood tests can sometimes be helpful in diagnosing other concurrent problems such as diabetes and certain infections.
A magnetic resonance imaging MRI or computed tomography CT scan can eliminate other structural causes of pressure on the facial nerve.
What Is Heart Failure?
Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.
In some cases, the heart can't fill with enough blood.
In other cases, the heart can't pump blood to the rest of the body with enough force.
Some people have both problems.
What are Arachnoid Cysts?
Arachnoid cysts are cerebrospinal fluid-filled sacs that are located between the brain or spinal cord and the arachnoid membrane, one of the three membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord.
Primary arachnoid cysts are present at birth and are the result of developmental abnormalities in the brain and spinal cord that arise during the early weeks of gestation.
Secondary arachnoid cysts are not as common as primary cysts and develop as a result of head injury, meningitis, or tumors, or as a complication of brain surgery.
The majority of arachnoid cysts form outside the temporal lobe of the brain in an area of the skull known as the middle cranial fossa.
Arachnoid cysts involving the spinal cord are rarer.
The location and size of the cyst determine the symptoms and when those symptoms begin.
Most individuals with arachnoid cysts develop symptoms before the age of 20, and especially during the first year of life, but some people with arachnoid cysts never have symptoms.
Males are four times more likely to have arachnoid cysts than females.
What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Cardiomyopathy?
Other signs and symptoms may include dizziness; light-headedness; fainting during physical activity; arrhythmias irregular heartbeats; chest pain, especially after physical exertion or heavy meals; and heart murmurs.

If you are having trouble sleeping, make changes to your routine to get the sleep you need.
What is Cerebral Aneurysms?
A cerebral aneurysm is a weak or thin spot on a blood vessel in the brain that balloons out and fills with blood.
An aneurysm can press on a nerve or surrounding tissue, and also leak or burst, which lets blood spill into surrounding tissues called a hemorrhage.
Cerebral aneurysms can occur at any age, although they are more common in adults than in children and are slightly more common in women than in men.
The signs and symptoms of an unruptured cerebral aneurysm will partly depend on its size and rate of growth.
For example, a small, unchanging aneurysm will generally produce no symptoms, whereas a larger aneurysm that is steadily growing may produce symptoms such as headache, numbness, loss of feeling in the face or problems with the eyes.
Immediately after an aneurysm ruptures, an individual may experience such symptoms as a sudden and unusually severe headache, nausea, vision impairment, vomiting, and loss of consciousness.
What Is Vasculitis?
Vasculitis vas-kyu-LI-tis is a condition that involves inflammation in the blood vessels.
The condition occurs if your immune system attacks your blood vessels by mistake.

What is irritable bowel syndrome IBS?
Irritable bowel syndrome is a functional gastrointestinal GI disorder, meaning symptoms are caused by changes in how the GI tract works.
People with a functional GI disorder have frequent symptoms; however, the GI tract does not become damaged.
IBS is a group of symptoms that occur together, not a disease.
In the past, IBS was called colitis, mucous colitis, spastic colon, nervous colon, and spastic bowel.
The name was changed to reflect the understanding that the disorder has both physical and mental causes and is not a product of a person's imagination.

Can people with TS control their tics?
Although the symptoms of TS are involuntary, some people can sometimes suppress, camouflage, or otherwise manage their tics in an effort to minimize their impact on functioning.
However, people with TS often report a substantial buildup in tension when suppressing their tics to the point where they feel that the tic must be expressed against their will.
Tics in response to an environmental trigger can appear to be voluntary or purposeful but are not.
What is the course of MS?
Finally, there are some rare and unusual variants of MS.
One of these is Marburg variant MS also called malignant MS, which causes a swift and relentless decline resulting in significant disability or even death shortly after disease onset.

What Causes the Disease?
Parkinson's disease occurs when nerve cells, or neurons, in the brain die or become impaired.
The main area affected is an area near the base of the brain called the substantia nigra.
Normally, the neurons in this area produce an important brain chemical known as dopamine.
Dopamine is a chemical messenger responsible for transmitting signals between the substantia nigra and the next relay station of the brain, the corpus striatum, to produce smooth, purposeful movement.
Loss of dopamine results in abnormal nerve firing patterns within the brain that cause impaired movement.
Studies have shown that most people with Parkinson's have lost 60 to 80 percent or more of the dopamine-producing cells in the substantia nigra by the time symptoms appear, and that people with PD also have loss of the nerve endings that produce the neurotransmitter norepinephrine.
Norepinephrine, which is closely related to dopamine, is the main chemical messenger of the sympathetic nervous system, the part of the nervous system that controls many automatic functions of the body, such as pulse and blood pressure.
The loss of norepinephrine might explain several of the non-motor features seen in PD, including fatigue and abnormalities of blood pressure regulation.
What is Myotonia congenita?
Myotonia congenita is an inherited neuromuscular disorder characterized by the inability of muscles to quickly relax after a voluntary contraction.
What are lipids?
These fatty materials are stored naturally in the body's cells, organs, and tissues.
Minute bodies within cells called lysosomes regularly convert, or metabolize, the lipids and proteins into smaller components to provide energy for the body.
Disorders in which intracellular material is stored are called lysosomal storage diseases.
In addition to lipid storage diseases, other lysosomal storage diseases include the mucolipidoses, in which excessive amounts of lipids and sugar molecules are stored in the cells and tissues, and the mucopolysaccharidoses, in which excessive amounts of sugar molecules are stored.
What is Dysgraphia?
Dysgraphia is a neurological disorder characterized by writing disabilities.
Specifically, the disorder causes a person's writing to be distorted or incorrect.
In children, the disorder generally emerges when they are first introduced to writing.
They make inappropriately sized and spaced letters, or write wrong or misspelled words, despite thorough instruction.
Children with the disorder may have other learning disabilities; however, they usually have no social or other academic problems.
Cases of dysgraphia in adults generally occur after some trauma.
In addition to poor handwriting, dysgraphia is characterized by wrong or odd spelling, and production of words that are not correct i.e., using boy for child.
The cause of the disorder is unknown, but in adults, it is usually associated with damage to the parietal lobe of the brain.
What is Echocardiography echo?
Echocardiography echo is the main test for diagnosing heart valve disease.
What is Barth Syndrome?
Barth syndrome BTHS is a rare, genetic disorder of lipid metabolism that primarily affects males.
It is caused by a mutation in the tafazzin gene TAZ, also called G4.5 which leads to decreased production of an enzyme required to produce cardiolipin.
Cardiolipin is an essential lipid that is important in energy metabolism.
BTHS, which affects multiple body systems, is considered serious.
Its main characteristics often include combinations in varying degrees of cardiomyopathy a disorder of the heart muscle leading to a poorly functioning heart, neutropenia a reduction in the number of white blood cells which may lead to an increased risk for bacterial infections, hypotonia reduced muscle tone, muscle weakness, undeveloped skeletal muscles, delayed growth, lack of stamina, varying degrees of physical disability, and methylglutaconic aciduria an increase in an organic acid that results in abnormal mitochondria function.
Although some with BTHS may have all of these characteristics, others may have only one or two, and, thus, are often misdiagnosed.
BTHS is an X-linked genetic condition passed from mother to son through the X chromosome.
A mother who is a carrier of BTHS shows no signs or symptoms of the disorder herself.
On average, 50 percent of children born to a carrier mother will inherit the defective gene, but only boys will develop symptoms.
All daughters born to an affected male will be carriers.

Sometimes a rash also occurs on the knees, elbows, and buttocks.
This rash may blister but won't itch.
Where do the livers for transplants come from?
All donated livers and living donors are tested before transplant surgery.
The testing makes sure the donor liver works as it should, matches your blood type, and is the right size, so it has the best chance of working in your body.
Adults usually receive the entire liver from a deceased donor.
Sometimes only a portion of a whole liver from a deceased donor is used to fit a smaller person.
In some cases, a liver from a deceased donor is split into two parts.
The smaller part may go to a child, and the larger part may go to an adult.
What is Myotonia?
Myotonia is a medical term that refers to a neuromuscular condition in which the relaxation of a muscle is impaired.
It can affect any muscle group.
Repeated effort will be needed to relax the muscle, although the condition usually improves after the muscles have warmed-up.
Individuals with myotonia may have trouble releasing their grip on objects or may have difficulty rising from a seated position.
They may walk with a stiff, awkward gait.
Myotonia is caused by an abnormality in the muscle membrane, and is often associated with inherited neurological disorders.
Myotonia is commonly seen in individuals with myotonic muscular dystrophy, myotonia congenita, and in people who have one of a group of neurological disorders called the channelopathies, which are inherited diseases that are caused by mutations in the chloride sodium or potassium channels that regulate the muscle membrane.
Myotonia may also be triggered by exposure to cold.
Why does my child need MCV4 vaccine?
The meningococcal conjugate vaccine MCV4 protects against 4 types of meningococcal disease, an infection that doesn't happen very often, but can be very dangerous when it does.
Meningococcal meningitis is a bacterial infection that can make the lining of the brain and spinal cord swell.
This can cause brain damage, hearing loss, and learning problems.
The meningococcal bacteria can also cause sepsis, which is an infection in the blood.
This infection can lead to the loss of an arm, leg or other parts of the body.
Even if they get treatment, about 1 in 10 people with meningococcal disease will die from it.

Mold exposure does not always present a health problem indoors.
However some people are sensitive to molds.
These people may experience symptoms such as nasal stuffiness, eye irritation, wheezing, or skin irritation when exposed to molds.
Some people may have more severe reactions to molds.
Severe reactions may occur among workers exposed to large amounts of molds in occupational settings, such as farmers working around moldy hay.
Severe reactions may include fever and shortness of breath.
Immunocompromised persons and persons with chronic lung diseases like COPD are at increased risk for opportunistic infections and may develop fungal infections in their lungs.
What is Craniosynostosis?
Craniosynostosis is a birth defect of the brain characterized by the premature closure of one or more of the fibrous joints between the bones of the skull called the cranial sutures before brain growth is complete.
Closure of a single suture is most common.
In contrast to normal skull growth, in which the skull expands uniformly to accommodate the growth of the brain, premature closure of a single suture restricts the growth in that part of the skull and promotes growth in other parts of the skull where sutures remain open.
This results in an abnormal shape of the skull, but does not prevent the brain from expanding to a normal volume.
However, when many sutures close prematurely, the skull cannot expand to accommodate the growing brain, which leads to increased pressure within the skull and impaired development of the brain.
Craniosynostosis can be gene-linked, or caused by metabolic diseases, such as rickets or an overactive thyroid.
Some cases are associated with other disorders such as microcephaly abnormally small head and hydrocephalus excessive accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain.
The first sign of craniosynostosis is an abnormally shaped skull.
Other features can include signs of increased intracranial pressure, developmental delays, or mental retardation, which are caused by constriction of the growing brain.
Seizures and blindness may also occur.
Do I need any other shots to help me stay healthy?
Have a health condition like HIV that makes it harder for your body to fight off infections.
How is syringomyelia treated?
In the case of trauma-related syringomyelia, the preferred surgical approach is to operate at the level of the initial injury to expand the space around the spinal cord and decrease fluid volume.
This operation is performed outside the spinal cord.
An alternate operation is to place a shunt in the syrinx, which requires a hole to be made in the spinal cord.
Shunts may injure the spinal cord and may require replacement if they clog over time.
Many surgeons now consider shunt placement only as a last resort.
Instead, surgeons usually choose to expand the space around the spinal cord.
This is done by removing scar tissue that 'tethers' the cord in place and prevents the free flow of CSF around it, and adding a patch to expand the 'dura,' the membrane that surrounds the spinal cord and contains the CSF a procedure called expansive duraplasty.
In some cases, the vertebrae may need to be realigned to correct spinal deformity that is narrowing the spinal column.
What research is being done for Tropical Spastic Paraparesis?
The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health NIH conduct research related to HAM/TSP in laboratories at the NIH, and support additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country.
Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure disorders such as HAM/TSP.

With good control, the risk of stroke in most age groups can be kept below that for accidental injury or death.
What Is Cystic Fibrosis?
Inherited means the disease is passed from parents to children through genes.
People who have CF inherit two faulty genes for the disease - one from each parent.
The parents likely don't have the disease themselves.
What is Human serum albumin?
Human serum albumin is a protein found in human blood plasma that may have neuroprotective benefit in stroke.
What is the prognosis for Tethered Spinal Cord Syndrome?
With treatment, individuals with tethered spinal cord syndrome have a normal life expectancy.

What is the treatment for hepatitis B?
Drugs approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B include alpha interferon and peginterferon, which slow the replication of the virus in the body and also boost the immune system, and the antiviral drugs lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, entecavir, and telbivudine.
Other drugs are also being evaluated.
Infants born to infected mothers should receive hepatitis B immune globulin and the hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth to help prevent infection.
Is there any treatment for Generalized Gangliosidoses?
No specific treatment exists for the gangliosidoses.
Anticonvulsants may initially control seizures.
Other supportive treatment includes proper nutrition and hydration and keeping the airway open.
What is Asperger Syndrome?
The most distinguishing symptom of AS is a child's obsessive interest in a single object or topic to the exclusion of any other.
Children with AS want to know everything about their topic of interest and their conversations with others will be about little else.
Their expertise, high level of vocabulary, and formal speech patterns make them seem like little professors.
Other characteristics of AS include repetitive routines or rituals; peculiarities in speech and language; socially and emotionally inappropriate behavior and the inability to interact successfully with peers; problems with non-verbal communication; and clumsy and uncoordinated motor movements.
What Causes an Arrhythmia?
A heart attack or other condition that damages the heart's electrical system also can cause arrhythmias.
Examples of such conditions include high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, heart failure, an overactive or underactive thyroid gland too much or too little thyroid hormone produced, and rheumatic heart disease.
Is there any treatment for Leukodystrophy?

How Can We Accelerate Progress?
Expanding national media campaigns so that ads air more frequently and for longer periods of time 12 months a year for at least the next 10 years.
Is there any treatment for Essential Tremor?
There is no definitive cure for essential tremor.
Symptomatic drug therapy may include propranolol or other beta blockers and primidone, an anticonvulsant drug.
Eliminating tremor triggers such as caffeine and other stimulants from the diet is often recommended.
Physical and occupational therapy may help to reduce tremor and improve coordination and muscle control for some individuals.
Deep brain stimulation uses a surgically implanted, battery-operated medical device called a neurostimulator to delivery electrical stimulation to targeted areas of the brain that control movement, temporarily blocking the nerve signals that cause tremor.
Other surgical intervention is effective but may have side effects.
What is the prognosis for Troyer Syndrome?
Prognosis varies, although the disease is progressive.
Some patients may have a mild form of the disease while others eventually lose the ability to walk normally.
Troyer syndrome does not shorten the normal life span.
What is Creating the Kock pouch?
Creating the Kock pouch is a delicate surgical procedure that requires a healthy bowel for proper healing.
What is Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome Disorder?
AGS is difficult to diagnose since many of the symptoms are similar to those of other disorders.
Diagnosis is made based on the clinical symptoms of the disease, as well as characteristic brain abnormalities that can be seen in an MRI brain scan.
Cerebrospinal fluid CSF, taken using a spinal tap, can also be tested for increased levels of a specific immune system cell a lymphocyte, which indicates a condition known as chronic lymphocytosis.
These cells are normally only elevated during infection, so that lymphocytosis without evidence of infection can be used as an indicator of AGS.
CSF may also be tested for elevated levels of a substance known as interferon-gamma, which can also support a diagnosis of AGS.
What other types of vascular lesions affect the central nervous system?
Cavernous malformations.
These lesions are formed from groups of tightly packed, abnormally thin-walled, small blood vessels that displace normal neurological tissue in the brain or spinal cord.
The vessels are filled with slow-moving or stagnant blood that is usually clotted or in a state of decomposition.
Like AVMs, cavernous malformations can range in size from a few fractions of an inch to several inches in diameter, depending on the number of blood vessels involved.
Some people develop multiple lesions.
Although cavernous malformations usually do not hemorrhage as severely as AVMs do, they sometimes leak blood into surrounding neurological tissues because the walls of the involved blood vessels are extremely fragile.
Although they are often not as symptomatic as AVMs, cavernous malformations can cause seizures in some people.
After AVMs, cavernous malformations are the type of vascular lesion most likely to require treatment.
What Research Is Being Done on Osteogenesis Imperfecta?
No medications are approved to treat OI.
But, experts are trying to learn more about:
What is the prognosis for Postural Tachycardia Syndrome?
POTS may follow a relapsing-remitting course, in which symptoms come and go, for years.
In most cases approximately 80 percent, an individual with POTS improves and becomes functional, although some residual symptoms are common.
What Does Hip Replacement Surgery Involve?
Cemented parts are fastened to existing, healthy bone with a special glue or cement.
Hip replacement using these parts is referred to as a 'cemented' procedure.
Uncemented parts rely on a process called biologic fixation, which holds them in place.
This means that the parts are made with a porous surface that allows your own bone to grow into the pores and hold the new parts in place.
Sometimes a doctor will use a cemented femur part and uncemented acetabular part.
This combination is referred to as a hybrid replacement.
Was the '2009 H1N1' pandemic virus the same as previously circulating human H1N1 viruses?
No.
The 2009 H1N1 viruses were antigenically and genetically very different from previously circulating human H1N1 viruses and, therefore, vaccines for human seasonal flu available at that time did not provide protection against 2009 H1N1 viruses.
However, these 2009 H1N1 viruses are now commonly spread in people and the current seasonal flu vaccines do provide protection against these viruses.
What is a mammogram?
When you get mammograms, the nurse will place your breasts, one at a time, between 2 plastic plates and take pictures of them.
Mammograms can be uncomfortable for some women, but they don't hurt.
How Is Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation Diagnosed?
Acute DIC requires emergency treatment.
The condition can be life threatening if it's not treated right away.
If you have signs or symptoms of severe bleeding or blood clots, call 9 - 1 - 1 right away.
How Did I Get Paget's Disease?
Doctors are not sure what causes the disease.
Some people have hereditary Paget's disease, which means it runs in their family and was passed down by their parents.
But most people do not have any relatives with Paget's disease.
Doctors think a virus may cause Paget's disease in some cases.
They are studying different kinds of viruses to try to find ones that may cause the disease.
What causes PSC?
PSC is linked to inflammatory bowel disease IBD.
About three out of four people with PSC have a type of IBD called ulcerative colitis.
The link between PSC and IBD is not yet understood.
What is Spinal Muscular Atrophy?
Spinal Muscular Atrophy SMA Types I, II, and III belong to a group of hereditary diseases that cause weakness and wasting of the voluntary muscles in the arms and legs of infants and children.
The disorders are caused by an abnormal or missing gene known as the survival motor neuron gene 1 SMN1, which is responsible for the production of a protein essential to motor neurons.
Without this protein, lower motor neurons in the spinal cord degenerate and die.
The type of SMA I, II, or III is determined by the age of onset and the severity of symptoms.
Type I also known as Werdnig-Hoffman disease, or infantile-onset SMA is evident at birth or within the first few months.
Symptoms include floppy limbs and trunk, feeble movements of the arms and legs, swallowing and feeding difficulties, and impaired breathing.
Type II the intermediate form usually begins 6 and 18 months of age.
Legs tend to be more impaired than arms.
Children with Type II may able to sit and some may be able to stand or walk with help.
Symptoms of Type III also called Kugelberg-Welander disease appear between 2 and 17 years of age and include difficulty running, climbing steps, or rising from a chair.
The lower extremities are most often affected.
Complications include scoliosis and chronic shortening of muscles or tendons around joints.
How does the flu spread?
Flu viruses spread mainly from person to person through coughing or sneezing of people with influenza.
Sometimes people may become infected by touching something with flu viruses on it and then touching their mouth or nose.
Most healthy adults may be able to infect others beginning 1 day before symptoms develop and up to 5 days after becoming sick.
That means that you may be able to pass on the flu to someone else before you know you are sick, as well as while you are sick.
How Does a Ventilator Work?
Ventilators blow air - or air with extra oxygen - into the airways and then the lungs.
The airways are pipes that carry oxygen-rich air to your lungs.
They also carry carbon dioxide, a waste gas, out of your lungs.
What is Radiation therapy?
Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.
How are the mucopolysaccharidoses treated?
Surgery to remove tonsils and adenoids may improve breathing among affected individuals with obstructive airway disorders and sleep apnea.
Sleep studies can assess airway status and the possible need for nighttime oxygen.
Some patients may require surgical insertion of an endotrachial tube to aid breathing.
Surgery can also correct hernias, help drain excessive cerebrospinal fluid from the brain, and free nerves and nerve roots compressed by skeletal and other abnormalities.
Corneal transplants may improve vision among patients with significant corneal clouding.
How can people decrease mold exposure?
Sensitive individuals should avoid areas that are likely to have mold, such as compost piles, cut grass, and wooded areas.
Inside homes, mold growth can be slowed by controlling humidity levels and ventilating showers and cooking areas.
If there is mold growth in your home, you should clean up the mold and fix the water problem.
Mold growth can be removed from hard surfaces with commercial products, soap and water, or a bleach solution of no more than 1 cup of bleach in 1 gallon of water.
What are the characteristics of tremor?
A useful way to understand and describe tremors is to define them according to the following types.
Restingtremor occurs when the muscle is relaxed, such as when the hands are lying on the lap or hanging next to the trunk while standing or walking.
It may be seen as a shaking of the limb, even when the person is at rest.
Often, the tremor affects only the hand or fingers.
This type of tremor is often seen in patients with Parkinson's disease.
An action tremor occurs during any type of movement of an affected body part.
There are several subclassifications of action tremor.
Postural tremor occurs when the person maintains a position against gravity, such as holding the arms outstretched.
Kinetictremor appears during movement of a body part, such as moving the wrists up and down, while intention tremor is present during a purposeful movement toward a target, such as touching a finger to one's nose during a medical exam.
Task-specific tremor appears when performing highly skilled, goal-oriented tasks such as handwriting or speaking.
Isometric tremor occurs during a voluntary muscle contraction that is not accompanied by any movement.
What should you expect during Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting?
Coronary artery bypass grafting CABG requires a team of experts.
A cardiothoracic surgeon will do the surgery with support from an anesthesiologist, perfusionist heart-lung bypass machine specialist, other surgeons, and nurses.
What are autoimmune diseases?
The body's immune system normally makes large numbers of proteins called antibodies to help the body fight off infections.
In some cases, however, the body makes autoantibodies.
Certain environmental triggers can lead to autoimmunity.
Environmental triggers are things originating outside the body, such as bacteria, viruses, toxins, and medications.
How is head lice infestation diagnosed?
The diagnosis of a head lice infestation is best made by finding a live nymph or adult louse on the scalp or hair of a person.
Because nymphs and adult lice are very small, move quickly, and avoid light, they can be difficult to find.
Use of a magnifying lens and a fine-toothed comb may be helpful to find live lice.
If crawling lice are not seen, finding nits firmly attached within a inch of base of the hair shafts strongly suggests, but does not confirm, that a person is infested and should be treated.
Nits that are attached more than inch from the base of the hair shaft are almost always dead or already hatched.
Nits are often confused with other things found in the hair such as dandruff, hair spray droplets, and dirt particles.
If no live nymphs or adult lice are seen, and the only nits found are more than -inch from the scalp, the infestation is probably old and no longer active and does not need to be treated.
How do doctors treat the symptoms of MS?
MS causes a variety of symptoms that can interfere with daily activities but which can usually be treated or managed to reduce their impact.
Many of these issues are best treated by neurologists who have advanced training in the treatment of MS and who can prescribe specific medications to treat the problems.
What is Wallenberg's syndrome?
Wallenberg's syndrome is a neurological condition caused by a stroke in the vertebral or posterior inferior cerebellar artery of the brain stem.

What is Behcet's disease?
Behcet's disease is a lifelong disorder that comes and goes.
What is Carboplatin?
Carboplatin is a cisplatin analog and is less nephrotoxic than cisplatin.
How Can Deep Vein Thrombosis Be Prevented?
Get out of bed and move around as soon as possible after surgery or illness as your doctor recommends.
Moving around lowers your chance of developing a blood clot.
What is the prognosis for Isaacs' Syndrome?
There is no cure for Isaacs' syndrome.
The long-term prognosis for individuals with the disorder is uncertain.
What are the complications of gastritis?
Most forms of chronic nonspecific gastritis do not cause symptoms.
However, chronic gastritis is a risk factor for peptic ulcer disease, gastric polyps, and benign and malignant gastric tumors.
Some people with chronic H.
pylori gastritis or autoimmune gastritis develop atrophic gastritis.
Atrophic gastritis destroys the cells in the stomach lining that produce digestive acids and enzymes.
Atrophic gastritis can lead to two types of cancer: gastric cancer and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue MALT lymphoma.
How Can Atelectasis Be Prevented?
Perform deep breathing exercises.
These exercises are very important after surgery.
While in the hospital, you may use a device called an incentive spirometer.
This device measures how much air you're breathing in and how fast you're breathing in.
Using this device encourages you to breathe deeply and slowly.
How would you characterize the response efforts? What were the most difficult aspects to respond to?
Response efforts were generally effective, given resources available at the time.
Major challenges related to uncertainties regarding who was in charge at the national and local levels, dealing with the 24 hr news cycle, staying ahead of CNN in release of information, maintaining situational awareness worked best in NYC, keeping the clinical and public health communities informed, communicating clear and consistent messages, characterizing powder preparations associated with cases including concerns about indicators of weaponization, sharing information among many agencies involved in the investigation.

What is Therapeutic phlebotomy?
Therapeutic phlebotomy is a procedure that removes blood and iron from your body.
What causes Whipple disease?
Bacteria called Tropheryma whippleiT.
whipplei cause Whipple disease.
T.
whipplei infection can cause internal sores, also called lesions, and thickening of tissues in the small intestine.
The villi take on an abnormal, clublike appearance and the damaged intestinal lining does not properly absorb nutrients, causing diarrhea and malnutrition.
Diarrhea is frequent, loose, and watery bowel movements.
Malnutrition is a condition that develops when the body does not get the right amount of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients it needs to maintain healthy tissues and organ function.
Over time, the infection spreads to other parts of the person's body and will damage other organs.
Is there any treatment for Complex Regional Pain Syndrome?
Because there is no cure for CRPS, treatment is aimed at relieving painful symptoms.
Doctors may prescribe topical analgesics, antidepressants, corticosteroids, and opioids to relieve pain.
However, no single drug or combination of drugs has produced consistent long-lasting improvement in symptoms.
Other treatments may include physical therapy, sympathetic nerve block, spinal cord stimulation, and intrathecal drug pumps to deliver opioids and local anesthetic agents via the spinal cord.
Q: How common is HPV?
A: HPV is very common.
In fact, it is the most common sexually-transmitted infection in the US.
HPV is so common that nearly all sexually-active men and women will get at least one type of HPV at some point in their lives.
Most people never know that they have been infected and may give HPV to a partner without knowing it.
About 79 million Americans are currently infected with HPV.
About 14 million people become newly infected each year.
What is Father's Day?
Father's Day is an occasion to celebrate the contribution that fathers and father figures make to children's lives.
What Research is Being Done?
Cutaneous allodynia is the feeling of pain or unpleasant sensations in response to normally nonpainful stimuli, such as light touch.
Researchers are investigating why it is present on the head or face in people with cluster headaches, to better understand neurological changes that occur with these headaches.
Similar research is looking at why some people with migraines have more than the typical restricted allodynia that affects a particular area of the head predicted by the headache for example, on the same side of the face as the migraine pain.
Individuals with extended allodynia may experience unpleasant sensations on the side of the face opposite the headache pain or even on their feet.
Previous studies have shown that sensitized nociceptors in the brain's coverings are involved in the throbbing pain of migraine and that other sensitized neurons found deeper in the brain are involved with restricted allodynia, but it is not certain which cells are responsible for extended allodynia.
Future studies will explore whether nerve cells in the thalamus which is involved in relaying signals between the brain and the body become more sensitive a result of the headache pain and cause extended allodynia.
Findings may offer a better understanding of how the nervous system changes and becomes more sensitive after repeated stimulation, resulting in chronic pain.
How does the doctor test for diverticular disease?
The doctor can test for diverticular disease many ways.
A CT scan is the most common test used.
The doctor will inject a liquid in a vein in your arm that better highlights your organs on x rays.
You may be asked to drink liquid called barium instead of getting an injection.
You are then placed in a large doughnut-shaped machine that takes x rays.
What research is being done for Opsoclonus Myoclonus?

These studies are aimed at increasing knowledge about these disorders and finding ways to prevent, treat, and cure them.
How Does Paget's Disease Cause Osteoarthritis?
Although they are different conditions, there is a link between Paget's disease and osteoarthritis.
The changes that occur in bones affected by Paget's disease can also affect the function of nearby joints.
As a result, people with Paget's disease frequently have osteoarthritis.
Paget's disease can cause osteoarthritis when it:
What is Cerebellar degeneration?
Cerebellar degeneration is a process in which neurons in the cerebellum - the area of the brain that controls coordination and balance - deteriorate and die.
What Is a Stent?
A stent is placed in an artery as part of a procedure called percutaneous per-ku-TA-ne-us coronary intervention PCI, sometimes referred to as coronary angioplasty AN-jee-oh-plas-tee.
PCI restores blood flow through narrow or blocked arteries.
A stent helps support the inner wall of the artery in the months or years after PCI.
How is gastroparesis diagnosed?
Upper GI series.
An upper GI series may be done to look at the small intestine.
The test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist - a doctor who specializes in medical imaging.
Anesthesia is not needed.
No eating or drinking is allowed for 8 hours before the procedure, if possible.
If the person has diabetes, a health care provider may give different instructions about fasting before the test.
During the procedure, the person will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid.
Barium coats the small intestine, making signs of gastroparesis show up more clearly on x rays.
Gastroparesis is likely if the x ray shows food in the stomach after fasting.
A person may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test.
For several days afterward, barium liquid in the GI tract causes stools to be white or light colored.
A health care provider will give the person specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test.
What research is being done for Arachnoiditis?
Within the NINDS research programs, arachnoiditis is addressed primarily through studies associated with pain research.
NINDS vigorously pursues a research program seeking new treatments for pain and nerve damage with the ultimate goal of reversing debilitating conditions such as arachnoiditis.

Signs and symptoms may include a bruit broo-E, a transient ischemic attack TIA, or a stroke.
What is Encephalitis Lethargica?
Encephalitis lethargica is a disease characterized by high fever, headache, double vision, delayed physical and mental response, and lethargy.
In acute cases, patients may enter coma.
Patients may also experience abnormal eye movements, upper body weakness, muscular pains, tremors, neck rigidity, and behavioral changes including psychosis.
The cause of encephalitis lethargica is unknown.
Between 1917 to 1928, an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica spread throughout the world, but no recurrence of the epidemic has since been reported.
Postencephalitic Parkinson's disease may develop after a bout of encephalitis-sometimes as long as a year after the illness.

What is liver transplantation?
Liver transplantation is surgery to remove a diseased or injured liver and replace it with a healthy whole liver or a segment of a liver from another person, called a donor.
A successful liver transplant is a life-saving treatment for people with liver failure, a condition in which the liver no longer works as it should.
What research is being done for Chronic?
The NINDS supports a broad program of research on disorders of the nervous system, including CIDP.
Much of this research is aimed at increasing the understanding of these disorders and finding ways to prevent, treat, and cure them.
What is the abdominal cavity?
The abdominal cavity is the internal area of the body between the chest and hips that contains the lower part of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine.
The esophagus carries food and liquids from the mouth to the stomach, which slowly pumps them into the small and large intestines.
Abdominal adhesions can kink, twist, or pull the small and large intestines out of place, causing an intestinal obstruction.
Intestinal obstruction, also called a bowel obstruction, results in the partial or complete blockage of movement of food or stool through the intestines.
Is there any treatment for Encephaloceles?
Generally, surgery is performed during infancy to place the protruding tissues back into the skull, remove the sac, and correct the associated craniofacial abnormalities.
Even large protrusions can often be removed without causing major functional disability.
Hydrocephalus associated with encephaloceles may require surgical treatment with a shunt.
Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
What are the symptoms of a Chiari malformation?
Individuals with CM may complain of neck pain, balance problems, muscle weakness, numbness or other abnormal feelings in the arms or legs, dizziness, vision problems, difficulty swallowing, ringing or buzzing in the ears, hearing loss, vomiting, insomnia, depression, or headache made worse by coughing or straining.
Hand coordination and fine motor skills may be affected.
Symptoms may change for some individuals, depending on the buildup of CSF and resulting pressure on the tissues and nerves.
Persons with a Type I CM may not have symptoms.
Adolescents and adults who have CM but no symptoms initially may, later in life, develop signs of the disorder.
Infants may have symptoms from any type of CM and may have difficulty swallowing, irritability when being fed, excessive drooling, a weak cry, gagging or vomiting, arm weakness, a stiff neck, breathing problems, developmental delays, and an inability to gain weight.
What is the GI tract?
The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus.
The movement of muscles in the GI tract, along with the release of hormones and enzymes, allows for the digestion of food.
Organs that make up the GI tract are the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine - which includes the appendix, cecum, colon, and rectum - and anus.
The intestines are sometimes called the bowel.
The last part of the GI tract - called the lower GI tract - consists of the large intestine and anus.
What is Osteoporosis?

What is Ethmocephaly?
Ethmocephaly is the least common facial anomaly.
Can PPS be prevented?
Polio survivors often ask if there is a way to prevent the development of PPS.
Presently, no intervention has been found to stop the deterioration of surviving neurons.
Physicians recommend that polio survivors get a good night's sleep, maintain a well-balanced diet, avoid unhealthy habits such as smoking and overeating, and follow a prescribed exercise program.
Lifestyle changes, such as weight control, the use of assistive devices, and taking certain anti-inflammatory medications, may help with some of the symptoms of PPS.
Is there any treatment for Stroke?
Generally there are three treatment stages for stroke: prevention, therapy immediately after the stroke, and post-stroke rehabilitation.
Therapies to prevent a first or recurrent stroke are based on treating an individual's underlying risk factors for stroke, such as hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes.
Acute stroke therapies try to stop a stroke while it is happening by quickly dissolving the blood clot causing an ischemic stroke or by stopping the bleeding of a hemorrhagic stroke.
Post-stroke rehabilitation helps individuals overcome disabilities that result from stroke damage.
Medication or drug therapy is the most common treatment for stroke.
The most popular classes of drugs used to prevent or treat stroke are antithrombotics antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants and thrombolytics.
How is it treated?
The fainting and lightheadedness from orthostatic hypotension is often treated successfully with simple interventions such as adding extra salt to the diet and avoiding heavy meals and alcohol.
Some people with MSA sleep with the head of the bed tilted up or use a compression body stocking.
The drugs fludrocortisone for those on a high salt diet and midodrine are sometimes prescribed to increase blood volume and narrow blood vessels.
Drinking a glass or two of water before getting out of bed in the morning can also help raise blood pressure.
What is Osteoporosis?
Osteoporosis is a real risk for older Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
What should you expect during Carotid Ultrasound?
Your technician or doctor will put the transducer against different spots on your neck and move it back and forth.
The transducer gives off ultrasound waves and detects their echoes as they bounce off the artery walls and blood cells.
Ultrasound waves can't be heard by the human ear.
What is Myasthenia Gravis?
Myasthenia gravis is a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disease characterized by varying degrees of weakness of the skeletal voluntary muscles of the body.
Symptoms vary in type and intensity.
The hallmark of myasthenia gravis is muscle weakness that increases during periods of activity and improves after periods of rest.
Muscles that control eye and eyelid movements, facial expression, chewing, talking, and swallowing are often, but not always, involved.
The muscles that control breathing and neck and limb movements may also be affected.
Myasthenia gravis is caused by a defect in the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles.
Normally when impulses travel down the nerve, the nerve endings release a neurotransmitter substance called acetylcholine.
In myasthenia gravis, antibodies produced by the body's own immune system block, alter, or destroy the receptors for acetylcholine.
The first noticeable symptoms of myasthenia gravis may be weakness of the eye muscles, difficulty in swallowing, or slurred speech.
Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease because the immune system--which normally protects the body from foreign organisms--mistakenly attacks itself.
It is not directly inherited nor is it contagious.
What is Rett syndrome?
Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmenal disorder that affects girls almost exclusively.
What is Bladder cancer?
Bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the United States after lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, and lymphoma.
What Causes Metabolic Syndrome?
People who have metabolic syndrome often have two other conditions: excessive blood clotting and constant, low-grade inflammation throughout the body.
Researchers don't know whether these conditions cause metabolic syndrome or worsen it.
Is there any treatment for Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum?
There is no standard course of treatment for ACC.
Treatment usually involves management of symptoms and seizures if they occur.
What is Zollinger-Ellison syndrome?
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is a rare disorder that occurs when one or more tumors form in the pancreas and duodenum.
The tumors, called gastrinomas, release large amounts of gastrin that cause the stomach to produce large amounts of acid.
Normally, the body releases small amounts of gastrin after eating, which triggers the stomach to make gastric acid that helps break down food and liquid in the stomach.
The extra acid causes peptic ulcers to form in the duodenum and elsewhere in the upper intestine.
What is Radiosurgery?
Radiosurgery is an even less invasive therapeutic approach
What Are Blood Tests?
Blood tests help doctors check for certain diseases and conditions.
They also help check the function of your organs and show how well treatments are working.
What is Hepatitis A?
Hepatitis A is a virus that can spread through food or water contaminated with fecal matter, even in microscopic amounts.
What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome?
You also may have rapid, shallow breathing.
During a physical exam, your doctor might hear abnormal heart sounds while listening to your heart with a stethoscope.
He or she also might notice that the opening to your throat is small and your neck is larger than normal.
What should you do if you are concerned?
In most cases, ADHD is best treated with a combination of medication and behavior therapy.
According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, treatment recommendations differ by age.
Younger children might benefit most from behavior treatment; older children may benefit more from medication.
Good treatment plans will include close monitoring, follow-ups and any changes needed along the way.
You can read about treatment recommendations here.
How do I prevent zoonotic diseases?
Closely supervise children to ensure they wash their hands properly and avoid hand - to - mouth activities thumb - sucking, eating, and use of pacifiers after animal contact.
What causes GERD in children and adolescents?
Children who have a history of esophageal surgery and children with severe developmental delays are more likely to develop GERD.
Pregnant adolescent girls may also develop GERD symptoms.
Any child or adolescent can develop GERD, some for unknown reasons.
What is Imatinib mesylate?
Imatinib mesylate is a medicine that's approved for treating leukemia.
How Are Knee Problems Diagnosed?
Doctors diagnose knee problems based on the findings of a medical history, physical exam, and diagnostic tests.
What is Malnutrition?
Malnutrition is a condition that occurs when the body does not get enough nutrients.
What are some of the other ways to measure obesity? Why doesn't CDC use those to determine overweight and obesity among the general public?
Other methods to measure body fatness include skinfold thickness measurements with calipers, underwater weighing, bioelectrical impedance, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry DXA, and isotope dilution.
However, these methods are not always readily available, and they are either expensive or need highly trained personnel.
Furthermore, many of these methods can be difficult to standardize across observers or machines, complicating comparisons across studies and time periods.
Is thimerosal in vaccines safe?
Three U.S.
health agencies The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC, the Food and Drug Administration FDA, and the National Institutes of Health NIH have reviewed the published research on thimerosal and found it to be a safe product to use in vaccines.
Three independent organizations [The National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine, Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ACIP, and the American Academy of Pediatrics AAP] reviewed the published research and also found thimerosal to be a safe product to use in vaccines.
The medical community supports the use of thimerosal in influenza vaccines to protect against potential bacterial contamination of multi-dose vials.
Is there any treatment for Chronic?
Treatment for CIDP includes corticosteroids such as prednisone, which may be prescribed alone or in combination with immunosuppressant drugs.
Plasmapheresis plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin IVIg therapy are effective.
IVIg may be used even as a first-line therapy.
Physiotherapy may improve muscle strength, function and mobility, and minimize the shrinkage of muscles and tendons and distortions of the joints.
What is the prognosis for Friedreich's Ataxia?
Generally, within 15 to 20 years after the appearance of the first symptoms, the person is confined to a wheelchair, and in later stages of the disease, individuals become completely incapacitated.
Most people with Friedreich's ataxia die in early adulthood if there is significant heart disease, the most common cause of death.
Some people with less severe symptoms live much longer.
What research is being done for Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome?
The gene associated with LNS is known.
The NINDS supports and conducts research on genetic disorders such as LNS in an effort to find ways to prevent and treat these disorders.
What is the prognosis for Transverse?
Recovery from transverse myelitis usually begins within 2 to 12 weeks of the onset of symptoms and may continue for up to 2 years and in some cases longer.
However, if there is no improvement within the first 3 to 6 months, complete recovery is unlikely although incomplete recovery can still occur, which underlines the significant need for aggressive physical therapy and rehabilitation.
Historic data, not controlling for more aggressive therapy, shows about one-third of people affected with transverse myelitis experience good or full recovery from their symptoms; they regain the ability to walk normally and experience minimal urinary or bowel effects and paresthesias.
Another one-third experience only fair recovery and are left with significant deficits such as spastic gait, sensory dysfunction, and prominent urinary urgency or incontinence.
The remaining one-third experience no recovery at all, remaining wheelchair-bound or bedridden with marked dependence on others for basic functions of daily living.
Unfortunately, making predictions about individual cases is difficult.
Aggressive acute treatment and physical therapy have been shown to improve outcomes.
However, research has shown that a rapid onset of symptoms generally results in poorer recovery outcomes.
What is A grade I meningioma?
A grade I meningioma is a slow-growing tumor.
What is Neuronal Migration Disorders?
Neuronal migration disorders NMDs are a group of birth defects caused by the abnormal migration of neurons in the developing brain and nervous system.
In the developing brain, neurons must migrate from the areas where they are born to the areas where they will settle into their proper neural circuits.
Neuronal migration, which occurs as early as the second month of gestation, is controlled by a complex assortment of chemical guides and signals.
When these signals are absent or incorrect, neurons do not end up where they belong.
This can result in structurally abnormal or missing areas of the brain in the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, brainstem, or hippocampus.
The structural abnormalities found in NMDs include schizencephaly, porencephaly, lissencephaly, agyria, macrogyria, polymicrogyria, pachygyria, microgyria, micropolygyria, neuronal heterotopias including band heterotopia, agenesis of the corpus callosum, and agenesis of the cranial nerves.
Symptoms vary according to the abnormality, but often feature poor muscle tone and motor function, seizures, developmental delays, mental retardation, failure to grow and thrive, difficulties with feeding, swelling in the extremities, and a smaller than normal head.
Most infants with an NMD appear normal, but some disorders have characteristic facial or skull features that can be recognized by a neurologist.
Several genetic abnormalities in children with NMDs have been identified.
Defects in genes that are involved in neuronal migration have been associated with NMDs, but the role they play in the development of these disorders is not yet well-understood.
More than 25 syndromes resulting from abnormal neuronal migration have been described.
Among them are syndromes with several different patterns of inheritance; genetic counseling thus differs greatly between syndromes.
Is there any treatment for Tethered Spinal Cord Syndrome?
MRI imaging is often used to evaluate individuals with these symptoms, and can be used to diagnose the location of the tethering, lower than normal position of the conus medullaris, or presence of a tumor or fatty mass lipoma.
In children, early surgery is recommended to prevent further neurological deterioration.
Regular follow-up is important: retethering may occur in some individuals during periods of rapid growth and may be seen between five to nine years of age.
If surgery is not advisable, spinal cord nerve roots may be cut to relieve pain.
In adults, surgery to free detether the spinal cord can reduce the size and further development of cysts in the cord and may restore some function or alleviate other symptoms.
Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
What is the prognosis for Giant Axonal Neuropathy?
GAN generally progresses slowly as neurons degenerate and die.
Most children have problems with walking in the early stages of the disorder.
Later they may lose sensation, coordination, strength, and reflexes in their arms and legs.
As time goes on, the brain and spinal cord may become involved, causing a gradual decline in mental function, loss of control of body movement, and seizures.
Most children become wheelchair dependent in the second decade of life.
Some children may survive into early adulthood.
How Can COPD Be Prevented?
You can take steps to prevent COPD before it starts.
If you already have COPD, you can take steps to prevent complications and slow the progress of the disease.
How Can Childhood Interstitial Lung Disease Be Prevented?
At this time, most types of childhood interstitial lung disease chILD can't be prevented.
People who have a family history of inherited genetic interstitial lung disease may want to consider genetic counseling.
A counselor can explain the risk of children inheriting chILD.
What research is being done for Guillain-Barre Syndrome?
Scientists are concentrating on finding new treatments and refining existing ones.
Scientists are also looking at the workings of the immune system to find which cells are responsible for beginning and carrying out the attack on the nervous system.
The fact that so many cases of Guillain-Barre begin after a viral or bacterial infection suggests that certain characteristics of some viruses and bacteria may activate the immune system inappropriately.
Investigators are searching for those characteristics.
Neurological scientists, immunologists, virologists, and pharmacologists are all working collaboratively to learn how to prevent this disorder and to make better therapies available when it strikes.
How does smoking affect heartburn and GERD?
Smoking increases the risk of heartburn and GERD.
Heartburn is a painful, burning feeling in the chest caused by reflux, or stomach contents flowing back into the esophagus - the organ that connects the mouth to the stomach.
Smoking weakens the lower esophageal sphincter, the muscle between the esophagus and stomach that keeps stomach contents from flowing back into the esophagus.
The stomach is naturally protected from the acids it makes to help break down food.
However, the esophagus is not protected from the acids.
When the lower esophageal sphincter weakens, stomach contents may reflux into the esophagus, causing heartburn and possibly damaging the lining of the esophagus.
How is transverse myelitis diagnosed?
Physicians diagnose transverse myelitis by taking a medical history and performing a thorough neurological examination.
Because it is often difficult to distinguish between a patient with an idiopathic form of transverse myelitis and one who has an underlying condition, physicians must first eliminate potentially treatable causes of the condition.
when a spinal cord problem is suspected, physicians seek first to rule out structurallesions damaged or abnormally functioning areas that could cause spinal cord compression or otherwise affects its function.
Such potential lesions include tumors, herniated or slipped discs, stenosis narrowing of the canal that holds the spinal cord, abscesses, and abnormal collections of blood vessels.
To rule out such lesions and check for inflammation of the spinal cord, patients often undergo magnetic resonance imaging MRI, a procedure that provides a picture of the brain and spinal cord.
The spinal cord MRI will almost always confirm the presence of a lesion within the spinal cord, whereas the brain MRI may provide clues to other underlying causes, especially MS.
If an MRI is not possible for example, if the patient has a pacemaker, physicians may consider other diagnostic tests such as computed tomography CT of the spine with or without myelography, which involves injecting a dye into the sac that surrounds the spinal cord.
The patient is then tilted up and down to let the dye flow around and outline the spinal cord while X-rays are taken.
What research is being done for Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum?
The NINDS conducts and supports a wide range of studies that explore the complex mechanisms of normal brain development.
The knowledge gained from these fundamental studies helps researchers understand how the process can go awry and provides opportunities for more effectively treating, and perhaps even preventing, developmental brain disorders such as ACC.

Treatment isn't a cure for the disorder and may not restore a normal QT interval on an EKG electrocardiogram.
However, treatment greatly improves the chances of survival.
What is Cirrhosis?
Cirrhosis is the 12th leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for nearly 32,000 deaths each year.
What causes vascular lesions?
By studying patterns of familial occurrence, researchers have established that one type of cavernous malformation involving multiple lesion formation is caused by a genetic mutation in chromosome 7.
This genetic mutation appears in many ethnic groups, but it is especially frequent in a large population of Hispanic Americans living in the Southwest; these individuals share a common ancestor in whom the genetic change occurred.
Some other types of vascular defects of the central nervous system are part of larger medical syndromes known to be hereditary.
They include hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu disease, Sturge-Weber syndrome, Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, Parkes-Weber syndrome, and Wyburn-Mason syndrome.
What is Powassan encephalitis?
Powassan encephalitis is the only well-documented tick-borne arbovirus in the United States and Canada.
What is Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome?
Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome LEMS is a disorder of the neuromuscular junction-the site where nerve cells meet muscle cells and help activate the muscles.
It is caused by a disruption of electrical impulses between these nerve and muscle cells.
LEMS is an autoimmune condition; in such disorders the immune system, which normally protects the body from foreign organisms, mistakenly attacks the body's own tissues.
The disruption of electrical impulses is associated with antibodies produced as a consequence of this autoimmunity.
Symptoms include muscle weakness, a tingling sensation in the affected areas, fatigue, and dry mouth.
LEMS is closely associated with cancer, in particular small cell lung cancer.
More than half the individuals diagnosed with LEMS also develop small cell lung cancer.
LEMS may appear up to 3 years before cancer is diagnosed.
What Causes Hypotension?
Conditions or factors that disrupt the body's ability to control blood pressure cause hypotension.
The different types of hypotension have different causes.
My 8-Year-Old Son Is a Daredevil and Has Already Broken Several Bones.
Could He Have a Problem Like Osteoporosis at This Young Age?
Osteoporosis is rare among children and adolescents.
When it occurs, it is usually caused by an underlying medical disorder or by medications used to treat such disorders.
This is called secondary osteoporosis.
It may also be the result of a genetic disorder such as osteogenesis imperfecta, in which bones break easily from little or no apparent cause.
Sometimes there is no identifiable cause of juvenile osteoporosis.
This is known as idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis.
Two or more low-impact fractures may be a sign of one of these disorders.
What are the rectum and sigmoid colon?
The rectum and sigmoid colon are parts of the gastrointestinal GI tract, a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus - the 1-inch opening through which stool leaves the body.
Organs that make up the GI tract are the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and anus.
The last part of the GI tract - called the lower GI tract - consists of the large intestine and anus.
How are the IRAT's 10 evaluation criteria ranked and weighted?
Each of the 10 evaluation criteria also are weighted according to importance to each of the two scenarios: emergence and public health impact.
As an example, when assessing an influenza virus for 'emergence,' the evaluation criteria may be ranked and weighted as follows with the first criterion receiving the highest rank and weight score, and the last criterion receiving the lowest rank and weight score.

Treatment for growth plate injuries depends on the type of injury.
In all cases, treatment should be started as soon as possible after injury and will generally involve a mix of the following:
What causes peptic ulcers?
H.
pylori is the most common cause of peptic ulcers.
Doctors think H.
pylori may be spread through unclean food or water or by mouth-to-mouth contact, such as kissing.
Even though many people have an H.
pylori infection, most of them never develop an ulcer.
What Is Carotid Endarterectomy?
Plaque is made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in the blood.
Over time, plaque hardens and narrows the carotid arteries.
This limits or blocks the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your brain, which can lead to a stroke.

Deep brain stimulation DBS is a surgical procedure used to treat several disabling neurological symptoms - most commonly the debilitating motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease PD, such as tremor, rigidity, stiffness, slowed movement, and walking problems.
What are anatomic problems of the lower gastrointestinal GI tract?
The large intestine is about 5 feet long in adults and absorbs water and any remaining nutrients from partially digested food passed from the small intestine.
The large intestine then changes waste from liquid to a solid matter called stool.
Stool passes from the colon to the rectum.
The rectum is 6 to 8 inches long in adults and is located between the last part of the colon - called the sigmoid colon - and the anus.
The rectum stores stool prior to a bowel movement.
During a bowel movement, the muscles of the rectal wall contract to move stool from the rectum to the anus, a 1-inch-long opening through which stool leaves the body.
What is Quitting smoking?
Quitting smoking is the most important thing you can do to lower your risk for AAA.

What is Developmental screening?
Developmental screening is a short test to tell if children are learning basic skills when they should, or if they might have delays.
What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Heart Disease?
The signs and symptoms of coronary heart disease CHD may differ between women and men.
Some women who have CHD have no signs or symptoms.
This is called silent CHD.
What Are the Symptoms?
The most common symptoms of the disorder are painful, misshapen, and/or broken bones fractures.
Fractures are more common between the ages of 6 and 10, but often persist into adulthood.
The problems a person experiences depend on which bones are affected.
For example, the legs can be of different lengths, leading to a limp and the need for a shoe lift.
The bones of the sinuses can be affected, leading to chronic sinus congestion.
Only very rarely do serious problems such as vision loss or cancer occur.
Is there any treatment for Paraneoplastic Syndromes?
When present, the tumor and cancer are treated first, followed by efforts to decrease the autoimmune response -- either through steroids such as cortisone or prednisone, high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin, or irradiation.
Plasmapheresis, a process that cleanses antibodies from the blood, may ease symptoms in people with paraneoplastic disorders that affect the peripheral nervous system.
Speech and physical therapy may help individuals regain some functions.

PSTT PSTT disease is the result of a very rare tumor arising from the placental implantation site and resembles an exaggerated form of syncytial endometritis.
How does smoking affect Crohn's disease?
Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease that causes irritation in the GI tract.
The disease, which typically causes pain and diarrhea, most often affects the lower part of the small intestine; however, it can occur anywhere in the GI tract.
The severity of symptoms varies from person to person, and the symptoms come and go.
Crohn's disease may lead to complications such as blockages of the intestine and ulcers that tunnel through the affected area into surrounding tissues.
Medications may control symptoms.
However, many people with Crohn's disease require surgery to remove the affected portion of the intestine.
What is the prognosis for Coma?
The outcome for coma and persistent vegetative state depends on the cause, severity, and site of neurological damage.
Individuals may emerge from coma with a combination of physical, intellectual, and psychological difficulties that need special attention.
Recovery usually occurs gradually, with some acquiring more and more ability to respond.
Some individuals never progress beyond very basic responses, but many recover full awareness.
Individuals recovering from coma require close medical supervision.
A coma rarely lasts more than 2 to 4 weeks.
Some patients may regain a degree of awareness after persistent vegetative state.
Others may remain in that state for years or even decades.
The most common cause of death for someone in a persistent vegetative state is infection, such as pneumonia.
What Is Diabetes?
Diabetes is a disease in which the body's blood glucose sugar level is too high.
Normally, the body breaks down food into glucose and carries it to cells throughout the body.
The cells use a hormone called insulin to turn the glucose into energy.
What is Your weight?
Your weight is the result of a balance between energy IN and energy OUT.
What research is being done for Brain and Spinal Tumors?
Scientists continue to investigate ways to better understand, diagnose, and treat CNS tumors.
Experimental treatment options may include new drugs, gene therapy, surgery , radiation, biologic immuno-agents that enhance the body's overall immune system to recognize and fight cancer cells, and a combination of therapies.
Of particular interest to scientists is the development of tailored therapeutics--involving a combination of targeted agents that use different molecules to reduce tumor gene activity and suppress uncontrolled growth by killing or reducing the production of tumor cells--to treat tumors based on their genetic makeup.
Researchers continue to search for additional clinical biomarkers molecules or other substances in the blood or tissue that can be used to diagnose or monitor a particular disorder of CNS tumors.
Other researchers are testing different drugs and molecules to see if they can modulate the normal activity of the blood-brain barrier and better target tumor cells and associated blood vessels.
Also under investigation are ways to help the body respond to improved drug delivery or other cancer treatments.

How Is Iron-Deficiency Anemia Treated?
Severe iron-deficiency anemia may require a blood transfusion, iron injections, or intravenous IV iron therapy.
Treatment may need to be done in a hospital.
How are these disorders transmitted?
Some forms of bacterial meningitis and encephalitis are contagious and can be spread through contact with saliva, nasal discharge, feces, or respiratory and throat secretions often spread through kissing, coughing, or sharing drinking glasses, eating utensils, or such personal items as toothbrushes, lipstick, or cigarettes.
For example, people sharing a household, at a day care center, or in a classroom with an infected person can become infected.
College students living in dormitories - in particular, college freshmen - have a higher risk of contracting meningococcal meningitis than college students overall.
Children who do not have access to childhood vaccines are at increased risk of developing certain types of bacterial meningitis.
How Is Paget's Disease Treated?
People with Paget's disease do not need a special diet.
But, to maintain strong bones, you should get 1,200 mg of calcium and at least 400 IU of vitamin D every day.

What is the gastrointestinal GI tract?
The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus.
The body digests food using the movement of muscles in the GI tract, along with the release of hormones and enzymes.
Organs that make up the GI tract are the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine - which includes the appendix, cecum, colon, and rectum - and anus.
The intestines are sometimes called the bowel.
The last part of the GI tract - called the lower GI tract - consists of the large intestine and anus.

Many of the Institutes at the NIH, including the NINDS, are sponsoring research to understand what causes AS and how it can be effectively treated.
One study is using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI to show how abnormalities in particular areas of the brain cause changes in brain function that result in the symptoms of AS and other ASDs.
Other studies include a clinical trial testing the effectiveness of an anti-depressant in individuals with AS and HFA who exhibit high levels of obsessive/ritualistic behavior and a long-range study to collect and analyze DNA samples from a large group of children with AS and HFA and their families to identify genes and genetic interactions that are linked to AS and HFA.
What is Radiation therapy?
Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.
What is Occipital Neuralgia?
Occipital neuralgia is a distinct type of headache characterized by piercing, throbbing, or electric-shock-like chronic pain in the upper neck, back of the head, and behind the ears, usually on one side of the head.
Typically, the pain of occipital neuralgia begins in the neck and then spreads upwards.
Some individuals will also experience pain in the scalp, forehead, and behind the eyes.
Their scalp may also be tender to the touch, and their eyes especially sensitive to light.
The location of pain is related to the areas supplied by the greater and lesser occipital nerves, which run from the area where the spinal column meets the neck, up to the scalp at the back of the head.
The pain is caused by irritation or injury to the nerves, which can be the result of trauma to the back of the head, pinching of the nerves by overly tight neck muscles, compression of the nerve as it leaves the spine due to osteoarthritis, or tumors or other types of lesions in the neck.
Localized inflammation or infection, gout, diabetes, blood vessel inflammation vasculitis, and frequent lengthy periods of keeping the head in a downward and forward position are also associated with occipital neuralgia.
In many cases, however, no cause can be found.
A positive response relief from pain after an anesthetic nerve block will confirm the diagnosis.
What is Multiple System Atrophy with Orthostatic Hypotension?
Multiple system atrophy with orthostatic hypotension is the current classification for a neurological disorder that was once called Shy-Drager syndrome.
A progressive disorder of the central and autonomic nervous systems, it is characterized by orthostatic hypotension an excessive drop in blood pressure when standing up which causes dizziness or fainting.
Multiple system atrophy can occur without orthostatic hypotension, but instead have urinary involvement urgency/incontinence.
Doctors classify the disorder into 3 types: the Parkinsonian-type includes symptoms of Parkinson's disease such as slow movement, stiff muscles, and tremor; the cerebellar-type, which causes problems with coordination and speech; and the combined-type, which includes symptoms of both parkinsonism and cerebellar failure.
Problems with urinary incontinence, constipation, and sexual impotence in men happen early in the course of the disease.
Other symptoms include generalized weakness, double vision or other vision disturbances, difficulty breathing and swallowing, sleep disturbances, and decreased sweating.
Because the disease resembles others, a correct diagnosis may take years.
How is the cause of constipation diagnosed?
To diagnose the cause of constipation, the health care provider will take a medical history, perform a physical exam, and order specific tests.
The tests ordered depend on how long the person has been constipated; how severe the constipation is; the person's age; and whether the person has had blood in stools, recent changes in bowel habits, or weight loss.
Most people with constipation do not need extensive testing and can be treated with changes in diet and exercise.
How Harmful is Secondhand Smoke?
Secondhand smoke also causes death and sickness in children.
Babies who are around secondhand smoke are more likely to die of sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS, than children who are not exposed to secondhand smoke.
Children whose parents smoke get more bronchitis and pneumonia, and they get more ear infections.
For a child with asthma, exposure to secondhand smoke can trigger an attack severe enough to send the child to the hospital.

Individuals may be asked about frequency, duration, and intensity of symptoms as well as their tendency toward daytime sleep patterns and sleepiness, disturbance of sleep, or daytime function.
How are febrile seizures prevented?
Children especially prone to febrile seizures may be treated with the drug diazepam orally or rectally, whenever they have a fever.
The majority of children with febrile seizures do not need to be treated with medication, but in some cases a doctor may decide that medicine given only while the child has a fever may be the best alternative.
This medication may lower the risk of having another febrile seizure.
It is usually well tolerated, although it occasionally can cause drowsiness, a lack of coordination, or hyperactivity.
Children vary widely in their susceptibility to such side effects.

Is Shingles Contagious?
A person with a shingles rash can pass the virus to someone, usually a child, who has never had chickenpox, In this case, the child will develop chickenpox, not shingles.
The child must come into direct contact with the open sores of the shingles rash.
Merely being in the same room with a shingles patient will not cause the child to catch chickenpox because during a shingles infection the virus is not normally in the lungs and therefore can't be spread through the air.
Q: Should boys get HPV vaccine too?
A: One HPV vaccine - the quadrivalent vaccine called Gardasil - is also for boys.
This vaccine helps prevent boys from getting infected with the types of HPV than can cause cancers of the throat, penis and anus.
The vaccine also prevents genital warts.
When boys are vaccinated, they are less likely to spread HPV to their current and future partners.

More than 99 percent of the body's calcium is contained in the bones and teeth.
The remaining 1 percent is found in the blood.
What research is being done on febrile seizures?
Investigators continue to monitor the long-term impact that febrile seizures might have on intelligence, behavior, school achievement, and the development of epilepsy.
For example, scientists conducting studies in animals are assessing the effects of febrile seizures, and especially very long seizures, on measures of intelligence and on the development of epilepsy.
In particular they are trying to see if they can predict which children experiencing a very long febrile seizure might be at a higher risk for these problems, and how this risk can be lessened or prevented.

Parkinson's disease PD is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system.
What is Schizencephaly?
Schizencephaly is an extremely rare developmental birth defect characterized by abnormal slits, or clefts, in the cerebral hemispheres of the brain.
Babies with clefts in both hemispheres called bilateral clefts commonly have developmental delays, delays in speech and language skills, and problems with brain-spinal cord communication.
Individuals with clefts in only one hemisphere called unilateral clefts are often paralyzed on one side of the body, but may have average to near-average intelligence.
Individuals with schizencephaly may also have an abnormally small head, mental retardation, partial or complete paralysis, or poor muscle tone.
Most will experience seizures.
Some individuals may have an excessive accumulation of fluid in the brain called hydrocephalus.

Studies show that cemented and uncemented prostheses have comparable rates of success.
Studies also indicate that if you need an additional hip replacement, or revision, the rates of success for cemented and uncemented prostheses are comparable.
However, more long-term data are available in the United States for hip replacements with cemented prostheses, because doctors have been using them here since the late 1960s, whereas uncemented prostheses were not introduced until the late 1970s.
What are the complications of foodborne illnesses?
Foodborne illnesses may lead to dehydration, hemolytic uremic syndrome HUS, and other complications.
Acute foodborne illnesses may also lead to chronic - or long lasting - health problems.
How is Pain Diagnosed?
Electrodiagnostic procedures include electromyography EMG, nerve conduction studies, and evoked potential EP studies.
Information from EMG can help physicians tell precisely which muscles or nerves are affected by weakness or pain.
Thin needles are inserted in muscles and a physician can see or listen to electrical signals displayed on an EMG machine.
With nerve conduction studies the doctor uses two sets of electrodes similar to those used during an electrocardiogram that are placed on the skin over the muscles.
The first set gives the patient a mild shock that stimulates the nerve that runs to that muscle.
The second set of electrodes is used to make a recording of the nerve's electrical signals, and from this information the doctor can determine if there is nerve damage.
EP tests also involve two sets of electrodes-one set for stimulating a nerve these electrodes are attached to a limb and another set on the scalp for recording the speed of nerve signal transmission to the brain.
If I have had a transfusion or a transplant, should I be concerned about getting Chagas disease?
Probably not.
The risk is very low.
You should, however, be aware of the potential risk for Chagas disease infection and the need to monitor your health.
If you have symptoms of Chagas disease or other concerns you should contact your health care provider.
What is Cardiac MRI?
Cardiac MRI is a fast, accurate tool that can help diagnose a heart attack.
My two children have the same BMI values, but one is considered obese and the other is not.
Why is that?
The interpretation of BMI-for-age varies by age and sex so if the children are not exactly the same age and of the same sex, the BMI numbers have different meanings.
Calculating BMI-for-age for children of different ages and sexes may yield the same numeric result, but that number will fall at a different percentile for each child for one or both of the following reasons:
What Are the Signs and Symptoms of a Heart Murmur?
People who have innocent harmless heart murmurs don't have any signs or symptoms other than the murmur itself.
This is because innocent heart murmurs aren't caused by heart problems.
What are the dangers?
Aneurysms may burst and bleed into the brain, causing serious complications, including hemorrhagic stroke, permanent nerve damage, or death.
Once it has burst, the aneurysm may burst again and bleed into the brain, and additional aneurysms may also occur.
More commonly, rupture may cause a subarachnoid hemorrhage - bleeding into the space between the skull bone and the brain.
A delayed but serious complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage is hydrocephalus, in which the excessive buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the skull dilates fluid pathways called ventricles that can swell and press on the brain tissue.
Another delayed postrupture complication is vasospasm, in which other blood vessels in the brain contract and limit blood flow to vital areas of the brain.
This reduced blood flow can cause stroke or tissue damage.
Is there any treatment for Wilson Disease?
WD requires lifelong treatment, generally using drugs that remove excess copper from the body and prevent it from re-accumulating.
Zinc, which blocks the absorption of copper in the stomach and causes no serious side effects, is often considered the treatment of choice.
Penicillamine and trientine are copper chelators that increase urinary excretion of copper; however, both drugs have some side effects.
Tetrathiomolybdate is an investigational copper chelating drug with a lower toxicity profile, but it has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of WD and its long-term safety and effectiveness aren't known.
A low-copper diet is also recommended, which involves avoiding mushrooms, nuts, chocolate, dried fruit, liver, and shellfish.
In rare cases where there is severe liver disease, a liver transplant may be needed.
Symptomatic treatment for symptoms of muscle spasm, stiffness, and tremor may include anticholinergics, tizanidine, baclofen, levodopa, or clonazepam.
What is Chemotherapy?
Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing.

What is the prognosis for Infantile Neuroaxonal Dystrophy?
INAD is a progressive disease.
Once symptoms begin, they will worsen over time.
Generally, a baby's development starts to slow down between the ages of 6 months to 3 years.
The first symptoms may be slowing of motor and mental development, followed by loss or regression of previously acquired skills.
Rapid, wobbly eye movements and squints may be the first symptoms, followed by floppiness in the body and legs more than in the arms.
For the first few years, a baby with INAD will be alert and responsive, despite being increasingly physically impaired.
Eventually, because of deterioration in vision, speech, and mental skills, the child will lose touch with its surroundings.
Death usually occurs between the ages of 5 to 10 years.
What is Parkinson's Disease?
Parkinson's disease belongs to a group of conditions called movement disorders.
The four main symptoms are tremor, or trembling in hands, arms, legs, jaw, or head; rigidity, or stiffness of the limbs and trunk; bradykinesia, or slowness of movement; and postural instability, or impaired balance.
These symptoms usually begin gradually and worsen with time.
As they become more pronounced, patients may have difficulty walking, talking, or completing other simple tasks.
Not everyone with one or more of these symptoms has PD, as the symptoms appear in other diseases as well.
How is diverticular disease treated?
Treatment for diverticular disease depends on how serious the problem is and whether you are suffering from diverticulosis or diverticulitis.

The doctor may use a special drug that makes the bleeding stop.
The doctor may also decide to operate and remove the part of the colon that is bleeding.
What is Autism?
Autistic children have difficulties with social interaction, display problems with verbal and nonverbal communication, and exhibit repetitive behaviors or narrow, obsessive interests.
These behaviors can range in impact from mild to disabling.
Autism varies widely in its severity and symptoms and may go unrecognized, especially in mildly affected children or when more debilitating handicaps mask it.
Scientists aren't certain what causes autism, but it's likely that both genetics and environment play a role.
How common are febrile seizures?
Approximately one in every 25 children will have at least one febrile seizure, and more than one-third of these children will have additional febrile seizures before they outgrow the tendency to have them.
Febrile seizures usually occur in children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years and are particularly common in toddlers.
Children rarely develop their first febrile seizure before the age of 6 months or after 3 years of age.
The older a child is when the first febrile seizure occurs, the less likely that child is to have more.

Drugs - In special circumstances, various drugs can ease the pain and swelling associated with carpal tunnel syndrome.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and other nonprescription pain relievers, may ease symptoms that have been present for a short time or have been caused by strenuous activity.
Orally administered diuretics water pills can decrease swelling.
Corticosteroids such as prednisone or the drug lidocaine can be injected directly into the wrist or taken by mouth in the case of prednisone to relieve pressure on the median nerve and provide immediate, temporary relief to persons with mild or intermittent symptoms.
Caution: persons with diabetes and those who may be predisposed to diabetes should note that prolonged use of corticosteroids can make it difficult to regulate insulin levels.
Corticosterioids should not be taken without a doctor's prescription.
Additionally, some studies show that vitamin B pyridoxine supplements may ease the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome.

What causes cerebral palsy?
Cerebral palsy is caused by abnormal development of part of the brain or by damage to parts of the brain that control movement.
This damage can occur before, during, or shortly after birth.
The majority of children have congenital cerebral palsy CP that is, they were born with it, although it may not be detected until months or years later.
A small number of children have acquired cerebral palsy, which means the disorder begins after birth.
Some causes of acquired cerebral palsy include brain damage in the first few months or years of life, brain infections such as bacterial meningitis or viral encephalitis, problems with blood flow to the brain, or head injury from a motor vehicle accident, a fall, or child abuse.

What is Ataxia Telangiectasia?
Ataxia-telangiectasia is a rare, childhood neurological disorder that causes degeneration in the part of the brain that controls motor movements and speech.
The first signs of the disease are unsteady walking and slurred speech, usually occurring during the first five years of life.
Telangiectasias tiny, red spider veins, which appear in the corners of the eyes or on the surface of the ears and cheeks, are characteristic of the disease, but are not always present and generally do not appear in the first years of life.
About 35 percent of those with A-T develop cancer, most frequently acute lymphocytic leukemia or lymphoma.
The most unusual symptom is an acute sensitivity to ionizing radiation, such as X-rays or gamma rays.
Many individuals with A-T have a weakened immune system, making them susceptible to recurrent respiratory infections.
Other features of the disease may include mild diabetes mellitus, premature graying of the hair, difficulty swallowing, and delayed physical and sexual development.
Children with A-T usually have normal or above normal intelligence.
What are the complications of PSC?
PSC can lead to various complications, including.
What is the prognosis for Tropical Spastic Paraparesis?

Kearns-Sayre syndrome KSS is a rare neuromuscular disorder with onset usually before the age of 20 years.
It is the result of abnormalities in the DNA of mitochondria - small rod-like structures found in every cell of the body that produce the energy that drives cellular functions.
The mitochondrial diseases correlate with specific DNA mutations that cause problems with many of the organs and tissues in the body.
KSS is characterized by progressive limitation of eye movements until there is complete immobility, accompanied by eyelid droop.
It is also associated with abnormal accumulation of pigmented material on the membrane lining the eyes.
Additional symptoms may include mild skeletal muscle weakness, heart block a cardiac conduction defect, short stature, hearing loss, an inability to coordinate voluntary movements ataxia, impaired cognitive function, and diabetes.
Seizures are infrequent.
Several endocrine disorders can be associated with KSS.

Is there any treatment for Central Cord Syndrome?
There is no cure for central cord syndrome although some people recover near-normal function.
There is no standard course of treatment, although drug therapy, surgery, and rest are often part of the program.
Magnetic resonance imaging MRI is used to indicate the degree of spinal cord compression and vertebral instability.
Vertebral instability due to acute traumatic injury or cervical disc herniation is often treated by surgery to prevent further damage to the spinal cord.
Recent reports indicate that earlier surgery may improve chances for recovery.
Numerous recent studies suggest that surgery also can be beneficial in individuals with persistent compression of the spinal cord and ongoing neurological deterioration.

What are the rectum and colon?
The rectum and colon are part of the gastrointestinal GI tract, a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus, a 1-inch-long opening through which stool leaves the body.
The body digests food using the movement of muscles in the GI tract, along with the release of hormones and enzymes.
Organs that make up the GI tract are the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine - which includes the appendix, cecum, colon, and rectum - and anus.
The intestines are sometimes called the bowel.
The last part of the GI tract - called the lower GI tract - consists of the large intestine and anus.

What is Foot Drop?
Foot drop describes the inability to raise the front part of the foot due to weakness or paralysis of the muscles that lift the foot.
As a result, individuals with foot drop scuff their toes along the ground or bend their knees to lift their foot higher than usual to avoid the scuffing, which causes what is called a 'steppage' gait.
Foot drop can be unilateral affecting one foot or bilateral affecting both feet.
Foot drop is a symptom of an underlying problem and is either temporary or permanent, depending on the cause.
Causes include: neurodegenerative disorders of the brain that cause muscular problems, such as multiple sclerosis, stroke, and cerebral palsy; motor neuron disorders such as polio, some forms of spinal muscular atrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease; injury to the nerve roots, such as in spinal stenosis; peripheral nerve disorders such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease or acquired peripheral neuropathy; local compression or damage to the peroneal nerve as it passes across the fibular bone below the knee; and muscle disorders, such as muscular dystrophy or myositis.

What Can I Do?
If your state still allows smoking in public areas, look for restaurants and other places that do not allow smoking.
Let owners of business that are not smoke-free know that smoke bothers you and that a no-smoking section is not good enough.
Remember, separating smokers from nonsmokers, cleaning the air, and ventilating buildings does NOT eliminate exposure to secondhand smoke.
Can People With Scoliosis Exercise?
Although exercise programs have not been shown to affect the natural history of scoliosis, exercise is encouraged in patients with scoliosis to minimize any potential decrease in functional ability over time.
It is very important for all people, including those with scoliosis, to exercise and remain physically fit.
Girls have a higher risk than boys of developing osteoporosis a disorder that results in weak bones that can break easily later in life.
The risk of osteoporosis can be reduced in women who exercise regularly all their lives.
Also, weight-bearing exercise, such as walking, running, soccer, and gymnastics, can increase bone density and help to prevent osteoporosis.
For both boys and girls, exercising and participating in sports can also improve their general sense of well-being.

Is there any treatment for Kleine-Levin Syndrome?
There is no definitive treatment for Kleine-Levin syndrome and watchful waiting at home, rather than pharmacotherapy, is most often advised.
Stimulant pills, including amphetamines, methylphenidate, and modafinil, are used to treat sleepiness but may increase irritability and will not improve cognitive abnormalities.
Because of similarities between Kleine-Levin syndrome and certain mood disorders, lithium and carbamazepine may be prescribed and, in some cases, have been shown to prevent further episodes.
This disorder should be differentiated from cyclic re-occurrence of sleepiness during the premenstrual period in teen-aged girls, which may be controlled with birth control pills.
It also should be differentiated from encephalopathy, recurrent depression, or psychosis.

What is Syncope?
There are several types of syncope.
Vasovagal syncope usually has an easily identified triggering event such as emotional stress, trauma, pain, the sight of blood, or prolonged standing.
Carotid sinus syncope happens because of constriction of the carotid artery in the neck and can occur after turning the head, while shaving, or when wearing a tight collar.
Situational syncope happens during urination, defecation, coughing, or as a result of gastrointestinal stimulation.
Syncope can also be a symptom of heart disease or abnormalities that create an uneven heart rate or rhythm that temporarily affect blood volume and its distribution in the body.
Syncope isn't normally a primary sign of a neurological disorder, but it may indicate an increased risk for neurologic disorders such as Parkinson's disease, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome POTS, diabetic neuropathy, and other types of neuropathy.
Certain classes of drugs are associated with an increased risk of syncope, including diuretics, calcium antagonists, ACE inhibitors, nitrates, antipsychotics, antihistamines, levodopa, narcotics, and alcohol.
What Are the Available Treatments?
The treatment strategies for Paget's disease and osteoarthritis are quite different, so it is important to distinguish between the two when making therapy-related decisions.
For example, people with both disorders who get good results from their Paget's disease treatment may continue to experience osteoarthritis-related pain.
Correctly identifying osteoarthritis as the source of pain is critical to the selection of effective treatments.
What is the prognosis for Neurological Consequences of Cytomegalovirus Infection?
Unborn infants whose mothers have CMVinfection.
CMV is the most common congenital infection in the U.S.
Most infants will have no permanent health consequences, but a small number will have at birth or will develop long-term neurological conditions, such as hearing loss, visual impairment, seizures, or disabilities f mental or physical function.
The highest risk of these severe effects on the fetus is for women who acquire CMV infection for the first time during pregnancy.
The risk is much lower for women who have had CMV infection in the past before pregnancy.

What is Secondhand smoke?
Secondhand smoke is the smoke that comes from the burning end of a cigarette, cigar, or pipe.
What Causes Epilepsy?
Epilepsy may develop because of an abnormality in brain wiring, an imbalance of nerve signaling chemicals called neurotransmitters, or some combination of these factors.
Researchers believe that some people with epilepsy have an abnormally high level of excitatory neurotransmitters that increase neuronal activity, while others have an abnormally low level of inhibitory neurotransmitters that decrease neuronal activity in the brain.
Either situation can result in too much neuronal activity and cause epilepsy.
One of the most-studied neurotransmitters that plays a role in epilepsy is GABA, or gamma-aminobutyric acid, which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter.
Research on GABA has led to drugs that alter the amount of this neurotransmitter in the brain or change how the brain responds to it.
Researchers also are studying excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate.
What is A nasoscope?
A nasoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing.
What is Chemotherapy?

What causes constipation?
Constipation is caused by stool spending too much time in the colon.
The colon absorbs too much water from the stool, making it hard and dry.
Hard, dry stool is more difficult for the muscles of the rectum to push out of the body.
What Causes Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation?
The two types of DIC are acute and chronic.
Acute DIC begins with clotting in the small blood vessels and quickly leads to serious bleeding.
Chronic DIC causes blood clotting, but it usually doesn't lead to bleeding.
Cancer is the most common cause of chronic DIC.
What is Myoclonus?
Myoclonus refers to a sudden, involuntary jerking of a muscle or group of muscles.
In its simplest form, myoclonus consists of a muscle twitch followed by relaxation.
A hiccup is an example of this type of myoclonus.
Other familiar examples of myoclonus are the jerks or sleep starts that some people experience while drifting off to sleep.
These simple forms of myoclonus occur in normal, healthy persons and cause no difficulties.
When more widespread, myoclonus may involve persistent, shock-like contractions in a group of muscles.
Myoclonic jerking may develop in people with multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
Myoclonic jerks commonly occur in persons with epilepsy, a disorder in which the electrical activity in the brain becomes disordered and leads to seizures.
Myoclonus may develop in response to infection, head or spinal cord injury, stroke, brain tumors, kidney or liver failure, lipid storage disease, chemical or drug poisoning, or other disorders.
It can occur by itself, but most often it is one of several symptoms associated with a wide variety of nervous system disorders.

Is there any treatment for Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis?
Currently, there is no cure for SSPE.
Clinical trials of antiviral isoprinosine and ribavirin and immunomodulatory interferon alpha drugs have suggested that these types of therapies given alone or in combination halt the progression of the disease and can prolong life, but their long-term effects on individuals, and eventual outcome, are unknown.
Good nursing care is the most important aspect of treatment for SSPE, along with anticonvulsant and antispasmodic drugs when needed.
How Is Marfan Syndrome Diagnosed?
If you're diagnosed with Marfan syndrome, all of your first-degree relatives for example, parents, siblings, and children also should be checked for the disorder.
This is because, even in families, the outward traits of Marfan syndrome may vary quite a bit.

Usually the effects only last for 1 or 2 days, but they may last up to 2 weeks.
What research is being done for Hydranencephaly?
The NINDS conducts and supports a wide range of studies that explore the complex mechanisms of normal brain development.
The knowledge gained from these fundamental studies provides the foundation for understanding how this process can go awry and, thus, offers hope for new means to treat and prevent developmental brain disorders, including hydranencephaly.
Am I Really at Risk?
Because more women get osteoporosis than men, many men think they are not at risk for the disease.
Many Hispanic and African American women are not concerned about their bones either.
They believe that osteoporosis is only a problem for white women.
However, it is a real risk for older men and women from all backgrounds.
What is the prognosis for Asperger Syndrome?
With effective treatment, children with AS can learn to cope with their disabilities, but they may still find social situations and personal relationships challenging.
Many adults with AS are able to work successfully in mainstream jobs, although they may continue to need encouragement and moral support to maintain an independent life.
What is BMI?
Body Mass Index BMI is a number calculated from a child's weight and height.
BMI is a reliable indicator of body fatness for most children and teens.
BMI does not measure body fat directly, but research has shown that BMI correlates to direct measures of body fat, such as underwater weighing and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry DXA.
BMI can be considered an alternative for direct measures of body fat.
Additionally, BMI is an inexpensive and easy-to-perform method of screening for weight categories that may lead to health problems.
What behavioral strategies help people cope with symptoms?
Safety precautions, particularly when driving, are particularly important for all persons with narcolepsy.
EDS and cataplexy can lead to serious injury or death if left uncontrolled.
Suddenly falling asleep or losing muscle control can transform actions that are ordinarily safe, such as walking down a long flight of stairs, into hazards.
People with untreated narcoleptic symptoms are involved in automobile accidents roughly 10 times more frequently than the general population.
However, accident rates are normal among individuals who have received appropriate medication.
Who needs to get their cholesterol checked?

What is Computerized tomography CT?
Computerized tomography CT is a quick and painless process used when disc rupture, spinal stenosis, or damage to vertebrae is suspected as a cause of low back pain.
What research is being done for Cerebral Palsy?
Researchers are investigating the roles of mishaps early in brain development, including genetic defects, which are sometimes responsible for the brain malformations and abnormalities that result in cerebral palsy.
Scientists are also looking at traumatic events in newborn babies' brains, such as bleeding, epileptic seizures, and breathing and circulation problems, which can cause the abnormal release of chemicals that trigger the kind of damage that causes cerebral palsy.
Researchers also hope to find ways to prevent white matter disease--the most common cause of cerebral palsy.
To make sure children are getting the right kinds of therapies, studies are also being done that evaluate both experimental treatments and treatments already in use so that physicians and parents have valid information to help them choose the best therapy.
What are CDC's recommendations for feeding infants?
This small study of perchlorate in infant formula made use of estimates and models of hypothetical exposure scenarios.
Because of the small number of samples tested, the findings cannot be generalized to entire brands of formula.
CDC has made no new recommendations based on the findings.

What is Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease?
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease CMT is one of the most common inherited neurological disorders, affecting approximately 1 in 2,500 people in the United States.
CMT, also known as hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy HMSN or peroneal muscular atrophy, comprises a group of disorders caused by mutations in genes that affect the normal function of the peripheral nerves.
The peripheral nerves lie outside the brain and spinal cord and supply the muscles and sensory organs in the limbs.
A typical feature includes weakness of the foot and lower leg muscles, which may result in foot drop and a high-stepped gait with frequent tripping or falling.
Foot deformities, such as high arches and hammertoes a condition in which the middle joint of a toe bends upwards, are also characteristic due to weakness of the small muscles in the feet.
In addition, the lower legs may take on an inverted champagne bottle appearance due to the loss of muscle bulk.
Later in the disease, weakness and muscle atrophy may occur in the hands, resulting in difficulty with fine motor skills.
Some individuals experience pain, which can range from mild to severe.
How is the cause of gas found?
If milk or milk products are causing gas, your health care provider may perform blood or breath tests to check for lactose intolerance.
Lactose intolerance means you have trouble digesting lactose.
Your health care provider may ask you to avoid milk and milk products for a short time to see if your gas symptoms improve.
Is thimerosal being used in other vaccines?
Since 2001, no new vaccine licensed by FDA for use in children has contained thimerosal as a preservative, and all vaccines routinely recommended by CDC for children younger than 6 years of age have been thimerosal-free, or contain only trace amounts of thimerosal, except for multi-dose formulations of influenza vaccine.
The most recent and rigorous scientific research does not support the argument that thimerosal-containing vaccines are harmful.
However, CDC and FDA continually evaluate new scientific information about the safety of vaccines.
How is ALS treated?
Individuals may eventually consider forms of mechanical ventilation respirators in which a machine inflates and deflates the lungs.
To be effective, this may require a tube that passes from the nose or mouth to the windpipe trachea and for long-term use, an operation such as a tracheostomy, in which a plastic breathing tube is inserted directly in the patient's windpipe through an opening in the neck.
Patients and their families should consider several factors when deciding whether and when to use one of these options.
Ventilation devices differ in their effect on the person's quality of life and in cost.
Although ventilation support can ease problems with breathing and prolong survival, it does not affect the progression of ALS.
People need to be fully informed about these considerations and the long-term effects of life without movement before they make decisions about ventilation support.
Are You or Your Loved Ones At Risk?

People who have family histories of aortic aneurysms are at higher risk for the condition, and they may have aneurysms before the age of 65.
How does a person prepare for a flexible sigmoidoscopy?
cleansing the bowel.
The health care provider will give written bowel prep instructions to follow at home.
A health care provider orders a bowel prep so that little to no stool is present inside the person's intestine.
A complete bowel prep lets the person pass stool that is clear.
Stool inside the colon can prevent the health care provider from clearly seeing the lining of the intestine.
Instructions may include following a clear liquid diet for 1 to 3 days before the procedure and avoiding drinks that contain red or purple dye.
The instructions will provide specific direction about when to start and stop the clear liquid diet.
During this diet, people may drink or eat the following: fat-free bouillon or broth.

What is Ohtahara Syndrome?
Ohtahara syndrome is a neurological disorder characterized by seizures.
The disorder affects newborns, usually within the first three months of life most often within the first 10 days in the form of epileptic seizures.
Infants have primarily tonic seizures, but may also experience partial seizures, and rarely, myoclonic seizures.
Ohtahara syndrome is most commonly caused by metabolic disorders or structural damage in the brain, although the cause or causes for many cases can't be determined.
Most infants with the disorder show significant underdevelopment of part or all of the cerebral hemispheres.
The EEGs of infants with Ohtahara syndrome reveal a characteristic pattern of high voltage spike wave discharge followed by little activity.
This pattern is known as 'burst suppression.' Doctors have observed that boys are more often affected than girls.
What causes Bacterial conjunctivitis?
Bacterial conjunctivitis is caused by infection of the eye with certain bacteria.
What should you expect before Blood Tests?
Other blood tests require fasting not eating any food for 8 to 12 hours before the test.
Your doctor will tell you how to prepare for your blood tests.
What aboutBRCA1/2 Genetic Testing?
Genetic testing is available to find out if a woman has inherited a change in either their BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene.
However, most breast and ovarian cancer is not caused by these genetic changes, so BRCA1/2 genetic testing will be helpful only for a small number of women.
If you are concerned about your family history, you should meet with a genetic counselor or other qualified health care professional to discuss:
What is Body Mass Index BMI?

What is a possible complication of autoimmune hepatitis and cirrhosis?
People with autoimmune hepatitis and cirrhosis are at risk of developing liver cancer.
A health care provider will monitor the person with a regular ultrasound examination of the liver.
Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure.
A specially trained technician performs the procedure in a health care provider's office, an outpatient center, or a hospital, and a radiologist - a doctor who specializes in medical imaging - interprets the images; anesthesia is not needed.
The images can show the liver's size and the presence of cancerous tumors.

Osteoporosis Management Strategies.
What is Osteoarthritis OA?
Osteoarthritis OA is a painful and often limiting joint disease that affects 27 million American adults.
What is the prognosis for Spinal Muscular Atrophy?
The prognosis is poor for babies with SMA Type I.
Most die within the first two years.
For children with SMA Type II, the prognosis for life expectancy or for independent standing or walking roughly correlates with how old they are when they first begin to experience symptoms - older children tend to have less severe symptoms Life expectancy is reduced but some individuals live into adolescence or young adulthood.
Individuals with SMA type III may be prone to respiratory infections but with care may have a normal lifespan.
What is The CDC Vital Signs program?
The CDC Vital Signs program is a call to action each month concerning a single, important public health topic.
What is a variant influenza virus?
When an influenza virus that normally circulates in swine but not people is detected in a person, it is called a 'variant influenza virus.' For example, if a swine origin influenza A H3N2 virus is detected in a person, that virus will be called an 'H3N2 variant' virus or 'H3N2v' virus.
This naming convention was first announced in a January 6, 2012 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report entitled Update: Influenza A H3N2v Transmission and Guidelines - Five States, 2011.

What is the prognosis for Myasthenia Gravis?
With treatment, most individuals with myasthenia can significantly improve their muscle weakness.
Some case of myasthenia gravis may go into remission temporarily, and muscle weakness may disappear so that medications can be discontinued.
In a few cases, the severe weakness of myasthenia gravis may cause respiratory failure, which requires immediate emergency medical care.
What causes gas?
Normally, few bacteria live in the small intestine.
Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth SIBO is an increase in the number of bacteria or a change in the type of bacteria in the small intestine.
These bacteria can produce excess gas and may also cause diarrhea and weight loss.
SIBO is usually related to diseases or disorders that damage the digestive system or affect how it works, such as Crohn's disease or diabetes.
What is the small intestine?
Most food digestion and nutrient absorption take place in the small intestine.
The small intestine measures about 20 feet long and includes the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.
Villi - tiny, fingerlike protrusions - line the inside of the small intestine.
Villi normally let nutrients from food be absorbed through the walls of the small intestine into the bloodstream.
How Can I Prevent Broken Bones if I Fall?
Sometimes you cannot prevent a fall.
If you do fall, you can try to prevent breaking a bone.
Try to fall forwards or backwards on your buttocks, because if you fall to the side you may break your hip.
You can also use your hands or grab things around you to break a fall.
Some people wear extra clothes to pad their hips or use special hip pads.
What is Hepatitis B?
Hepatitis means inflammation of the liver.
Hepatitis B is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with the Hepatitis B virus.
When a person becomes infected, the Hepatitis B virus can stay in the person's body for the rest of his or her life and cause serious liver problems, including liver cancer.
Unfortunately, up to two-thirds of Americans with chronic hepatitis B may be living with the virus and do not know they are infected.
What Is Aplastic Anemia?
Red blood cells carry oxygen to all parts of your body.
They also carry carbon dioxide a waste product to your lungs to be exhaled.
White blood cells help your body fight infections.

What research is being done for Myasthenia?
Different drugs are being tested, either alone or in combination with existing drug therapies, to see if they are effective in treating myasthenia gravis.
One study is examining the use of methotrexate therapy in individuals who develop symptoms and signs of the disease while on prednisone therapy.
The drug suppresses blood cell activity that causes inflammation.
Another study is investigating the use of rituximab, a monoclonal antibody against B cells which make antibodies, to see if it decreases certain antibodies that cause the immune system to attack the nervous system.
Investigators are also determining if eculizumab is safe and effective in treating individuals with generalized myasthenia gravis who also receive various immunosuppressant drugs.
What is Calcitonin?
Calcitonin is a hormone involved in calcium regulation and bone metabolism.
What research is being done for Neurofibromatosis?
Several years ago, research teams located the exact position of the NF1 gene on chromosome 17.
The product of the NF1 gene is a large and complex protein called neurofibromin, which is primarily active in nervous cells as a regulator of cell division.
Intensive efforts have let to the identification of the NF2 gene on chromosome 22.
The NF2 gene product is a tumor-suppressor protein called merlin.
Ongoing research continues to discover additional genes that appear to play a role in NF-related tumor suppression or growth.
Other research is aimed at understanding how the genetic mutations that cause the benign tumors of NF1 also cause nerve cells and nerve networks to form abnormally during fetal development, which later result in the learning disabilities and cognitive deficits of children with the disorder.
Additional research is aimed at understanding the natural history of tumors in NF2 and determining possible factors that may regular their growth patterns.
The Interinstitute Medical Genetics Research Program at the NIH Clinical Center conducts NF2 family history research.
Using specimens from some of the families, scientists have isolated and sequenced the NF2 gene and have described two different patterns of clinical features in NF2 patients.
Investigators are continuing to study these patterns to see if they correspond to specific types of gene mutations.
How is celiac disease diagnosed?
Your doctor will provide you instructions about how to prepare for a biopsy.
Generally, no eating or drinking is allowed 8 hours before a biopsy.
Smoking and chewing gum are also prohibited during this time.
Tell your doctor about any health conditions you may have, especially heart and lung problems, diabetes, and allergies.
Also tell your doctor about any medicines you take.
You may be asked to stop taking them for a short time before and after the test.
What is the prognosis for Central Cord Syndrome?
The prognosis for central cord syndrome varies, but most people whose syndrome is caused by trauma have some recovery of neurological function.
Evaluation of abnormal signals on MRI images can help predict he likelihood that neurological recovery may occur naturally.
Those who receive medical intervention soon after their injury often have good outcomes.
Many people with the disorder recover substantial function after their initial injury, and the ability to walk is recovered in most cases, although some impairment may remain.
Improvement occurs first in the legs, then the bladder, and may be seen in the arms.
Hand function recovers last, if at all.
Recovery is generally better in younger patients, compared to those over the age of 50.
How often do I need to get my cholesterol checked?
The general recommendation is to get your cholesterol checked every 5 years.
Some people need to get their cholesterol checked more or less often.
Talk to your doctor about what's best for you.
How is TSC diagnosed?
Diagnosis of the disorder is based on a careful clinical exam in combination with computed tomography CT or magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the brain, which may show tubers in the brain, and an ultrasound of the heart, liver, and kidneys, which may show tumors in those organs.
Doctors should carefully examine the skin for the wide variety of skin features, the fingernails and toenails for ungual fibromas, the teeth and gums for dental pits and/or gum fibromas, and the eyes for retinal lesions.
A Wood's lamp or ultraviolet light may be used to locate the hypomelantic macules which are sometimes hard to see on infants and individuals with pale or fair skin.
Because of the wide variety of signs of TSC, it is best if a doctor experienced in the diagnosis of TSC evaluates a potential patient.
What happens during a depression screening?
The doctor will ask your teen questions about her feelings and behaviors.
The doctor may ask her how often she:
Q: How well does HPV vaccine work?
A: The HPV vaccine works extremely well.
Clinical trials showed the vaccines provided close to 100% protection against precancers and for HPV4, genital warts.
Since the vaccine was first recommended in 2006, there has been a 56% reduction in HPV infections among teen girls in the US, even with very low HPV vaccination rates.
Research has also shown that fewer teens are getting genital warts.
In other countries such as Australia where there is higher HPV vaccination coverage, HPV vaccine has also reduced the number of cases of precancers of the cervix in young women in that country.
Also, genital warts decreased dramatically in young women and men in Australia since the HPV vaccine was introduced.
What is the cost of stroke for our nation?
Stroke places a major health burden on our society in terms of mortality, morbidity and economic costs.
The National Stroke Association estimates stroke costs the U.S.
about $43 billion a year.
Direct costs for medical care and therapy average $28 billion a year.
The average cost per patient for the first 90 days after a stroke is $15,000 although 10 percent of those cases exceed $35,000.
What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Raynaud's?

The prognosis for individuals with LEMS varies.
Those with LEMS not associated with malignancy have a benign overall prognosis.
Generally the presence of cancer determines the prognosis.
What is the prognosis for Reye's Syndrome?
Recovery from RS is directly related to the severity of the swelling of the brain.
Some people recover completely, while others may sustain varying degrees of brain damage.
Those cases in which the disorder progresses rapidly and the patient lapses into a coma have a poorer prognosis than those with a less severe course.
Statistics indicate that when RS is diagnosed and treated in its early stages, chances of recovery are excellent.
When diagnosis and treatment are delayed, the chances for successful recovery and survival are severely reduced.
Unless RS is diagnosed and treated successfully, death is common, often within a few days.

What is Hirschsprung disease HD?
Hirschsprung* disease HD is a disease of the large intestine that causes severe constipation or intestinal obstruction.
Constipation means stool moves through the intestines slower than usual.
Bowel movements occur less often than normal and stools are difficult to pass.
Some children with HD can't pass stool at all, which can result in the complete blockage of the intestines, a condition called intestinal obstruction.
People with HD are born with it and are usually diagnosed when they are infants.
Less severe cases are sometimes diagnosed when a child is older.
An HD diagnosis in an adult is rare.

What is Deep Brain Stimulation for Parkinson's Disease?
Deep brain stimulation DBS is a surgical procedure used to treat several disabling neurological symptoms - most commonly the debilitating motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease PD, such as tremor, rigidity, stiffness, slowed movement, and walking problems.
The procedure is also used to treat essential tremor and dystonia.
At present, the procedure is used only for individuals whose symptoms cannot be adequately controlled with medications.
However, only individuals who improve to some degree after taking medication for Parkinson's benefit from DBS.
A variety of conditions may mimic PD but do not respond to medications or DBS.
DBS uses a surgically implanted, battery-operated medical device called an implantable pulse generator IPG - similar to a heart pacemaker and approximately the size of a stopwatch - to deliver electrical stimulation to specific areas in the brain that control movement, thus blocking the abnormal nerve signals that cause PD symptoms.
What should you expect after Bronchoscopy?

Sterile procedures and equipment are routine at blood banks.
Is there any treatment for Tardive Dyskinesia?
Treatment is highly individualized.
The first step is generally to stop or minimize the use of the neuroleptic drug, but this can be done only under close supervision of the physician.
However, for patients with a severe underlying condition this may not be a feasible option.
Replacing the neuroleptic drug with substitute drugs may help some individuals.
The only approved drug treatment for tardive dyskenesia is tetrabenazine, which is usually effective but can have side effects that need to be discussed prior to starting therapy.
Other drugs such as benzodiazepines, clozapine, or botulinum toxin injections also may be tried.
Is there a vaccine for canine influenza?
Yes, an approved vaccine is available.
How is viral gastroenteritis transmitted?
Viral gastroenteritis is transmitted from person to person.
Viruses are present in the stool and vomit of people who are infected.
Infected people may contaminate surfaces, objects, food, and drinks with viruses, especially if they do not wash their hands thoroughly after using the bathroom.
When an infected person with unwashed hands shakes hands with or touches another person, the virus can spread.
When an infected person vomits, the virus can become airborne.

How is BMI calculated and interpreted for children and teens?
3.
Review the calculated BMI-for-age percentile and results.
The BMI-for-age percentile is used to interpret the BMI number because BMI is both age-and sex-specific for children and teens.
These criteria are different from those used to interpret BMI for adults - which do not take into account age or sex.
Age and sex are considered for children and teens for two reasons:
How does the screening test protect people from Chagas disease?

How is autism diagnosed?
A comprehensive evaluation requires a multidisciplinary team, including a psychologist, neurologist, psychiatrist, speech therapist, and other professionals who diagnose children with ASDs.
The team members will conduct a thorough neurological assessment and in-depth cognitive and language testing.
Because hearing problems can cause behaviors that could be mistaken for an ASD, children with delayed speech development should also have their hearing tested.
What is Neurosarcoidosis?
Neurosarcoidosis is a manifestation of sarcoidosis in the nervous system.
Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disorder that typically occurs in adults between 20 and 40 years of age and primarily affects the lungs, but can also impact almost every other organ and system in the body.
Neurosarcoidosis is characterized by inflammation and abnormal cell deposits in any part of the nervous system - the brain, spinal cord, or peripheral nerves.
It most commonly occurs in the cranial and facial nerves, the hypothalamus a specific area of the brain, and the pituitary gland.
It is estimated to develop in 5 to 15 percent of those individuals who have sarcoidosis.
Weakness of the facial muscles on one side of the face Bell's palsy is a common symptom of neurosarcoidosis.
The optic and auditory nerves can also become involved, causing vision and hearing impairments.
It can cause headache, seizures, memory loss, hallucinations, irritability, agitation, and changes in mood and behavior.
Neurosarcoidosis can appear in an acute, explosive fashion or start as a slow chronic illness.
Because neurosarcoidosis manifests in many different ways, a diagnosis may be difficult and delayed.
How Is Deep Vein Thrombosis Treated?

Some may also require treatment with an immunosuppressive drug, such as cyclophosphamide.
When do symptoms appear?
Signs of NF2 may be present in childhood but are so subtle that they can be overlooked, especially in children who don't have a family history of the disorder.
Typically, symptoms of NF2 are noticed between 18 and 22 years of age.
The most frequent first symptom is hearing loss or ringing in the ears tinnitus.
Less often, the first visit to a doctor will be because of disturbances in balance, visual impairment such as vision loss from cataracts, weakness in an arm or leg, seizures, or skin tumors.
What is hemochromatosis?
Hemochromatosis is the most common form of iron overload disease.
Too much iron in the body causes hemochromatosis.
Iron is important because it is part of hemoglobin, a molecule in the blood that transports oxygen from the lungs to all body tissues.
However, too much iron in the body leads to iron overload - a buildup of extra iron that, without treatment, can damage organs such as the liver, heart, and pancreas; endocrine glands; and joints.

Rh factor is a protein on red blood cells.
What is primary biliary cirrhosis?
The bile ducts carry a fluid called bile from the liver to the gallbladder, where it is stored.
When food enters the stomach after a meal, the gallbladder contracts, and the bile ducts carry bile to the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine, for use in digestion.
The liver makes bile, which is made up of bile acids, cholesterol, fats, and fluids.
Bile helps the body absorb fats, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins.
Bile also carries cholesterol, toxins, and waste products to the intestines, where the body removes them.
When chronic inflammation, or swelling, damages the bile ducts, bile and toxic wastes build up in the liver, damaging liver tissue.
What is breast cancer?
About 1 in 8 women born today in the United States will get breast cancer.

What does recovery from ERCP involve?
After ERCP, patients are moved to a recovery room where they wait for about an hour for the sedatives to wear off.
Patients may not remember conversations with health care staff, as the sedatives reduce memory of events during and after the procedure.
During this time, patients may feel bloated or nauseous.
Patients may also have a sore throat, which can last a day or two.
What is the gastrointestinal GI tract?
The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus - the opening through which stool leaves the body.
The body digests food using the movement of muscles in the GI tract, along with the release of hormones and enzymes.
Cyclic vomiting syndrome affects the upper GI tract, which includes the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and duodenum, the first part of the small intestine.
The esophagus is the muscular tube that carries food and liquids from the mouth to the stomach.
The stomach slowly pumps the food and liquids through the duodenum and into the rest of the small intestine, which absorbs nutrients from food particles.
This process is automatic and people are usually not aware of it, though people sometimes feel food in their esophagus when they swallow something too large, try to eat too quickly, or drink hot or cold liquids.
What is Hemicrania Continua?
Hemicrania continua is a chronic and persistent form of headache marked by continuous pain that varies in severity, always occurs on the same side of the face and head, and is superimposed with additional debilitating symptoms.
on the continuous but fluctuating pain are occasional attacks of more severe pain.
A small percentage of individuals with hemicrania continua have bilateral pain, or pain on both sides of the head.
A headache is considered hemicrania continua if the person has had a one-sided daily or continuous headache of moderate intensity with occasional short, piercing head pain for more than 3 months without shifting sides or pain-free periods.
The headache must also be completely responsive to treatment with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug drug indomethacin.
It must have at least one of the following symptoms: eye redness and/or tearing, nasal congestion and/or runny nose, ptosis drooping eyelid and miosis contracture of the iris.
Occasionally, individuals will also have forehead sweating and migraine symptoms, such as throbbing pain, nausea and/or vomiting, or sensitivity to light and sound.
The disorder has two forms: chronic, with daily headaches, and remitting, in which headaches may occur for a period as long as 6 months and are followed by a pain-free period of weeks to months until the pain returns.
Most patients experience attacks of increased pain three to five times per 24-hour cycle.
This disorder is more common in women than in men.
Physical exertion and alcohol use may increase the severity of headache pain in some patients.
The cause of this disorder is unknown.
What is the prognosis for Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease?
Onset of symptoms of CMT is most often in adolescence or early adulthood, however presentation may be delayed until mid-adulthood.
Progression of symptoms is very gradual.
The degeneration of motor nerves results in muscle weakness and atrophy in the extremities arms, legs, hands, or feet, and the degeneration of sensory nerves results in a reduced ability to feel heat, cold, and pain.
There are many forms of CMT disease.
The severity of symptoms may vary greatly among individuals and some people may never realize they have the disorder.
CMT is not fatal and people with most forms of CMT have a normal life expectancy.
What is known about Alzheimer's Disease?

What is Headache treatment?
Headache treatment is a partnership between you and your doctor, and honest communication is essential.
Do symptoms of autism change over time?
For many children, symptoms improve with treatment and with age.
Children whose language skills regress early in life - before the age of 3 - appear to have a higher than normal risk of developing epilepsy or seizure-like brain activity.
During adolescence, some children with an ASD may become depressed or experience behavioral problems, and their treatment may need some modification as they transition to adulthood.
People with an ASD usually continue to need services and supports as they get older, but many are able to work successfully and live independently or within a supportive environment.
What research is being done for Hemicrania Continua?
The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health NIH support research related to hemicrania continua through grants to medical research institutions across the country.
Much of this research focuses on understanding hemicrania continua in order to finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure the disorder.

The cause of congenital heart valve disease isn't known.
It occurs before birth as the heart is forming.
Congenital heart valve disease can occur alone or with other types of congenital heart defects.
Is there any treatment for Cerebral Aneurysms?
For unruptured aneurysms, treatment may be recommended for large or irregularly-shaped aneurysms or for those causing symptoms.
Emergency treatment for individuals with a ruptured cerebral aneurysm may be required to restore deteriorating respiration and reduce abnormally high pressure within the brain.
Treatment is necessary to prevent the aneurysm from rupturing again.
Surgical treatment prevents repeat aneurysm rupture by placing a metal clip at the base of the aneurysm.
Individuals for whom surgery is considered too risky may be treated by inserting the tip of a catheter into an artery in the groin and advancing it through the blood stream to the site of the aneurysm, where it is used to insert metal coils that induce clot formation within the aneurysm.
What research is being done for Shingles?
The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health NIH conduct shingles research in laboratories at the NIH and also support additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country.

Is there any treatment for Parry-Romberg?
There is no cure and there are no treatments that can stop the progression of Parry-Romberg syndrome.
Reconstructive or microvascular surgery may be needed to repair wasted tissue.
The timing of surgical intervention is generally agreed to be the best following exhaustion of the disease course and completion of facial growth.
Most surgeons will recommend a waiting period of one or two years before proceeding with reconstruction.
Muscle or bone grafts may also be helpful.
Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
Who funded the work described in this article?
Work with the reconstructed 1918 virus was conducted at and supported by CDC.
The U.S.
Department of Agriculture USDA, the National Institutes of Health NIH, and the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology AFIP all provided support for many other aspects of this research.

The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS, a part of the National Institutes of Health NIH, conducts research about Niemann-Pick disease in laboratories at the NIH and also supports additional research through grants to major research institutions across the country.
Investigators at the NINDS have identified two different genes that, when defective, contribute to Niemann-Pick disease types C and D.
How is celiac disease diagnosed?
Recognizing celiac disease can be difficult because some of its symptoms are similar to those of other diseases.
Celiac disease can be confused with irritable bowel syndrome, iron-deficiency anemia caused by menstrual blood loss, inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulitis, intestinal infections, and chronic fatigue syndrome.
As a result, celiac disease has long been underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed.
As doctors become more aware of the many varied symptoms of the disease and reliable blood tests become more available, diagnosis rates are increasing.

The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS conducts and supports an extensive research program of basic science to increase understanding of how the nervous system works and what causes the system to sometimes go awry, leading to dysfunction.
Part of this research program focuses on learning more about the circumstances that lead to nerve damage and the conditions that cause injuries and damage to nerves.
Knowledge gained from this research may help scientists find the definitive cause of Bell's palsy, leading to the discovery of new effective treatments for the disorder.
Other NINDS-supported research is aimed at developing methods to repair damaged nerves and restore full use and strength to injured areas, and finding ways to prevent nerve damage and injuries from occurring.
What are Nearly 1 in 5 teen births?
Nearly 1 in 5 teen births is a repeat birth.
What immediate treatments are available?
At the hospital or trauma center, realigning the spine using a rigid brace or axial traction using a mechanical force to stretch the spine and relieve pressure on the spinal cord is usually done as soon as possible to stabilize the spine and prevent additional damage.
Fractured vertebrae, bone fragments, herniated discs, or other objects compressing the spinal column may need to be surgically removed.
Spinal decompression surgery to relieve pressure within the spinal column also may be necessary in the days after injury.
Results of a neurosurgical study show that, in some cases, earlier surgery is associated with better functional recovery.
What causes intestinal pseudo-obstruction?
Some people have duplications or deletions of genetic material in the FLNA gene.
Researchers believe that these genetic changes may impair the function of a protein, causing problems with the nerve cells in the intestines.
As a result, the nerves cannot work with the intestinal muscles to produce normal contractions that move food, fluid, and air through the digestive tract.
Also, these genetic changes may account for some of the other signs and symptoms that can occur with intestinal pseudo-obstruction, such as bladder symptoms and muscle weakness.
What should people do if they think they have appendicitis?
Appendicitis is a medical emergency that requires immediate care.
People who think they have appendicitis should see a health care provider or go to the emergency room right away.
Swift diagnosis and treatment reduce the chances the appendix will burst and improve recovery time.
What are critical congenital heart defects?
The seven defects classified as critical congenital heart defects CCHDs are hypoplastic left heart syndrome, pulmonary atresia with intact septum, tetralogy of Fallot, total anomalous pulmonary venous return, transposition of the great arteries, tricuspid atresia, and truncus arteriosus.
Babies with one these CCHDs are at significant risk for death or disability if their heart defect is not diagnosed and treated soon after birth.
These seven CCHDs among some babies potentially can be detected using pulse oximetry screening, which is a test to determine the amount of oxygen in the blood and pulse rate.
Certain hospitals routinely screen all newborns using pulse oximetry screening.
However, pulse oximetry screening is not currently included in newborn screening in most states.
If the chance of the diseases is so low, why do I need the vaccine?
It is true that vaccination has enabled us to reduce measles and most other vaccine-preventable diseases to very low levels in the United States.
However, measles is still very common - even epidemic - in other parts of the world.
Visitors to our country and unvaccinated U.S.
travelers returning from other countries can unknowingly bring import measles into the United States.
Since the virus is highly contagious, such imported cases can quickly spread, causing outbreaks or epidemics among unvaccinated people and under-vaccinated communities.
What is Coffin Lowry Syndrome?
Coffin-Lowry syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by craniofacial head and facial and skeletal abnormalities, mental retardation, short stature, and hypotonia.
Characteristic facial features may include an underdeveloped upper jaw bone maxillary hypoplasia, a broad nose, protruding nostrils nares, an abnormally prominent brow, down-slanting eyelid folds palpebral fissures, widely spaced eyes hypertelorism, large low-set ears, and unusually thick eyebrows.
Skeletal abnormalities may include abnormal front-to-back and side-to-side curvature of the spine kyphoscoliosis, unusual prominence of the breastbone pigeon chest, or pectus carinatum, dental abnormalities, and short, hyperextensible, tapered fingers.
Other features may include feeding and respiratory problems, developmental delay, mental retardation, hearing impairment, awkward gait, stimulus-induced drop episodes, and heart and kidney involvement.
The disorder affects males and females in equal numbers, but symptoms are usually more severe in males.
The disorder is caused by a defective gene, RSK2, which is found in 1996 on the X chromosome Xp22.2-p22.1.
Thus, the syndrome is typically more severe in males because males have only one X chromosome, while females have two.
It is unclear how changes mutations in the DNA structure of the gene lead to the clinical findings.
Who Gets Paget's Disease?
Uncommon in people under age 40, Paget's disease grows more common with age.
The condition is more common in people of Anglo-Saxon descent in certain geographical areas including England, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and Western Europe.
It is not common in Scandinavia, China, Japan, or India.

relieve symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding.
Are there prenatal tests for the neurofibromatoses?
Clinical genetic testing can confirm the presence of a mutation in the NF1 gene.
Prenatal testing for the NF1 mutation is also possible using amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling procedures.
Genetic testing for the NF2 mutation is sometimes available, but is accurate only in about 65 percent of those individuals tested.
Prenatal or genetic testing for schwannomotosis currently does not exist.

Oseltamivir is also approved for the prevention of influenza in persons aged one year and older.
Zanamivir Relenza is approved for the treatment of influenza in persons aged 7 years and older; and for the prevention of influenza in persons aged 5 years and older.
How are these disorders diagnosed?
Genetic testing can help individuals who have a family history of lipid storage disease determine if they are carrying a mutated gene that causes the disorder.
Other genetic tests can determine if a fetus has the disorder or is a carrier of the defective gene.
Prenatal testing is usually done by chorionic villus sampling, in which a very small sample of the placenta is removed and tested during early pregnancy.
The sample, which contains the same DNA as the fetus, is removed by catheter or fine needle inserted through the cervix or by a fine needle inserted through the abdomen.
Results are usually available within 2 weeks.
What should you expect during Pacemaker Surgery?
First, your doctor will insert a needle into a large vein, usually near the shoulder opposite your dominant hand.
Your doctor will then use the needle to thread the pacemaker wires into the vein and to correctly place them in your heart.
What is heart disease?
When someone has CHD, the coronary arteries tubes that take blood to the heart are narrow or blocked.
This happens when cholesterol and fatty material, called plaque 'plak', build up inside the arteries.
What causes diverticulosis and diverticular disease?
Scientists are not certain what causes diverticulosis and diverticular disease.
For more than 50 years, the most widely accepted theory was that a low-fiber diet led to diverticulosis and diverticular disease.
Diverticulosis and diverticular disease were first noticed in the United States in the early 1900s, around the time processed foods were introduced into the American diet.
Consumption of processed foods greatly reduced Americans' fiber intake.
Diverticulosis and diverticular disease are common in Western and industrialized countries - particularly the United States, England, and Australia - where low-fiber diets are common.
The condition is rare in Asia and Africa, where most people eat high-fiber diets.
Two large studies also indicate that a low-fiber diet may increase the chance of developing diverticular disease.

Myelomeningocele, the fourth form, is the most severe and occurs when the spinal cord/neural elements are exposed through the opening in the spine, resulting in partial or complete paralysis of the parts of the body below the spinal opening.
The impairment may be so severe that the affected individual is unable to walk and may have bladder and bowel dysfunction.
How are variant influenza viruses spread?
Influenza viruses can be directly transmitted from pigs to people and from people to pigs.
When a human is infected with a flu virus that normally circulates in pigs, this virus is called a 'variant virus' because it is different from seasonal influenza viruses.
These infections have been most likely to occur when people are in close proximity to infected pigs, such as in pig barns and livestock exhibits housing pigs at fairs.
This is thought to happen mainly when an infected pig coughs or sneezes and droplets with influenza virus in them spread through the air.
If these droplets land in your nose or mouth, or are inhaled, you can be infected.
There also is some evidence that you might get infected by touching something that has virus on it and then touching your own mouth or nose.
A third way to possibly get infected is to inhale dust containing influenza virus.
Scientists aren't really sure which of these ways of spread is the most common.
What research is being done for Developmental Dyspraxia?
The NINDS supports research on developmental disorders, such as developmental dyspraxia, aimed at learning more about these disorders, and finding ways to prevent and treat them.
What is Kuru?
Kuru belongs to a class of infectious diseases called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies TSEs, also known as prion diseases.
The hallmark of a TSE disease is misshapen protein molecules that clump together and accumulate in brain tissue.
Scientists believe that misshapen prion proteins have the ability to change their shape and cause other proteins of the same type to also change shape.
Other TSEs include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and fatal familial insomnia in humans, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle also known as mad cow disease, scrapie in sheep and goats, and chronic wasting disease in deer and elk.
What is Osteoporosis?
Osteoporosis is a condition in which the bones become less dense and more likely to fracture.
How Is Osteoporosis Diagnosed in Men?
Osteoporosis can be effectively treated if it is detected before significant bone loss has occurred.
A medical workup to diagnose osteoporosis will include a complete medical history, x-rays, and urine and blood tests.
The doctor may also order a bone mineral density test.
This test can identify osteoporosis, determine your risk for fractures broken bones, and measure your response to osteoporosis treatment.
The most widely recognized BMD test is called a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, or DXA test.
It is painless a bit like having an x-ray, but with much less exposure to radiation.
It can measure bone density at your hip and spine.

Current NINDS-funded research includes studies to better understand the genetic factors responsible for the malformation, and factors that influence the development, progression, and relief of symptoms among people with syringomyelia, including those with Chiari I malformations.
How is IBS in children diagnosed?
To diagnose IBS, a health care provider will conduct a physical exam and take a complete medical history.
The medical history will include questions about the child's symptoms, family members with GI disorders, recent infections, medications, and stressful events related to the onset of symptoms.
IBS is diagnosed when the physical exam does not show any cause for the child's symptoms and the child meets all of the following criteria:
What does You Should Know and Do thi Flu Season If You Are 65 Year and Older?
It has been recognized for many years that people 65 years and older are at greater risk of serious complications from the flu compared with young, healthy adults.
It's estimated that 90 percent of seasonal flu-related deaths and more than 60 percent of seasonal flu-related hospitalizations in the United States each year occur in people 65 years and older.
This is because human immune defenses become weaker with age.
So influenza can be a very serious disease for people 65 and older.
What Other Medical Problems Might Occur?
Arthritis.
The long bones in your leg may bow and press on nearby joints.
Enlarged bone may cause more wear and tear on joints.
In these cases, joint pain may be due to both Paget's disease and arthritis.
Is there any treatment for Arachnoiditis?
Arachnoiditis remains a difficult condition to treat, and long-term outcomes are unpredictable.
Most treatments for arachnoiditis are focused on pain relief and the improvement of symptoms that impair daily function.
A regimen of pain management, physiotheraphy, exercise, and psychotheraphy is often recommended.
Surgical intervention is controversial since the outcomes are generally poor and provide only short-term relief.
Clinical trials of steroid injections and electrical stimulation are needed to evaluate the efficacy of these treatments.

How common are Chiari malformations?
In the past, it was estimated that the condition occurs in about one in every 1,000 births.
However, the increased use of diagnostic imaging has shown that CM may be much more common.
Complicating this estimation is the fact that some children who are born with the condition may not show symptoms until adolescence or adulthood, if at all.
CMs occur more often in women than in men and Type II malformations are more prevalent in certain groups, including people of Celtic descent.

What is Cerebral Palsy?
The term cerebral palsy refers to any one of a number of neurological disorders that appear in infancy or early childhood and permanently affect body movement and muscle coordination but don't worsen over time.
Even though cerebral palsy affects muscle movement, it isn't caused by problems in the muscles or nerves.
It is caused by abnormalities in parts of the brain that control muscle movements.
The majority of children with cerebral palsy are born with it, although it may not be detected until months or years later.
The early signs of cerebral palsy usually appear before a child reaches 3 years of age.
The most common are a lack of muscle coordination when performing voluntary movements ataxia; stiff or tight muscles and exaggerated reflexes spasticity; walking with one foot or leg dragging; walking on the toes, a crouched gait, or a 'scissored' gait; and muscle tone that is either too stiff or too floppy.
A small number of children have cerebral palsy as the result of brain damage in the first few months or years of life, brain infections such as bacterial meningitis or viral encephalitis, or head injury from a motor vehicle accident, a fall, or child abuse.
Am I at risk?
Some older adults also have vision problems or other medical conditions that can make a fall more likely.
For example, a stroke can affect your balance and make you more likely to fall.
Who Has Rheumatoid Arthritis?
According to the National Arthritis Data Workgroup, the actual number of new cases of rheumatoid arthritis is lower than previous estimates because of changes in the classification for the condition, as cited in Helmick CG, Felson DT, Lawrence RC, Gabriel S, Hirsch R, Kwoh CK, Liang MH, Kremers HM, Mayes MD, Merkel PA, Pillemer SR, Reveille JD, Stone JH, for the National Arthritis Data Workgroup.

What Causes Lymphocytopenia?
Many diseases, conditions, and factors can lead to a low lymphocyte count.
These conditions can be acquired or inherited.
Acquired means you aren't born with the condition, but you develop it.
Inherited means your parents passed the gene for the condition on to you.
How is the bat influenza virus different from other influenza viruses?
The bat influenza virus discovered in Guatemala is very different from other influenza viruses in humans and animals.
All influenza A viruses have hemagglutinin HA surface proteins, and until the discovery of this virus, there were only 16 different classes or 'subtypes' of HA proteins known to exist in nature.
This new bat virus is distinct enough from those pre-existing subtypes that CDC scientists have classified it as a new subtype, denoted as 'H17'.
The other surface protein-coding gene of the virus, neuraminidase NA, is extraordinarily different from that of known influenza viruses, as well.
It is possible this gene came from ancient bat influenza viruses that are extinct or yet to be discovered.
For additional information on influenza virus biology and pictures of influenza viruses, see Influenza Flu Viruses and Images of Influenza Viruses.

A child may need antibiotics or medications that target parasites to treat infections that do not go away on their own.
A health care provider may also prescribe antibiotics to treat small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
How is HD Inherited?
A single abnormal gene, the basic biological unit of heredity, produces HD.
Genes are composed of deoxyribonucleic acid DNA, a molecule shaped like a spiral ladder.
Each rung of this ladder is composed of two paired chemicals called bases.
There are four types of bases - adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine - each abbreviated by the first letter of its name: A, T, C, and G.
Certain bases always pair together, and different combinations of base pairs join to form coded messages.
A gene is a long string of this DNA in various combinations of A, T, C, and G.
These unique combinations determine the gene's function, much like letters join together to form words.
Each person has about 30,000 genes - a billion base pairs of DNA or bits of information repeated in the nuclei of human cells - which determine individual characteristics or traits.
Is there any treatment for Multiple Sclerosis?
While steroids do not affect the course of MS over time, they can reduce the duration and severity of attacks in some patients.
Spasticity, which can occur either as a sustained stiffness caused by increased muscle tone or as spasms that come and go, is usually treated with muscle relaxants and tranquilizers such as baclofen, tizanidine, diazepam, clonazepam, and dantrolene.
Physical therapy and exercise can help preserve remaining function, and patients may find that various aids -- such as foot braces, canes, and walkers -- can help them remain independent and mobile.
Avoiding excessive activity and avoiding heat are probably the most important measures patients can take to counter physiological fatigue.
If psychological symptoms of fatigue such as depression or apathy are evident, antidepressant medications may help.
Other drugs that may reduce fatigue in some, but not all, patients include amantadine Symmetrel, pemoline Cylert, and the still-experimental drug aminopyridine.
Although improvement of optic symptoms usually occurs even without treatment, a short course of treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone Solu-Medrol followed by treatment with oral steroids is sometimes used.
What Causes Hemophilia?
If you have inherited hemophilia, you're born with the disorder.

What can you do to reduce your risk of stroke?
To reduce your risk of stroke monitor your blood pressure, track your cholesterol level, stop smoking, exercise regularly and find out if you should be taking a drug to reduce blood clotting.
What are the symptoms of SMA in children?
SMA Type II, also known as juvenile SMA, intermediate SMA, or chronic SMA, has an onset between 6 and 18 months.
Legs tend to be more impaired than arms.
The first indication that a baby may have the disease is when he or she fails to crawl or walk.
Children with Type II are usually able to sit without support if placed in position.
Some may be able to stand or walk with help.
Although children with SMA Type II may not need artificial assistance to breathe, they are still at an increased risk for respiratory infections.
These children often survive into adulthood, but with significant motor disability.
What is Chemotherapy Chemotherapy?
Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is the primary treatment modality for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancers.
How Is It Diagnosed?
To be classified as juvenile arthritis, symptoms must have started before age 16.
Doctors usually suspect juvenile arthritis, along with several other possible conditions, when they see children with persistent joint pain or swelling, unexplained skin rashes, and fever associated with swelling of lymph nodes or inflammation of internal organs.
A diagnosis of juvenile arthritis also is considered in children with an unexplained limp or excessive clumsiness.
At what age should children receive rotavirus vaccine?
RotaTeq is administered in a 3-dose series, with doses administered at ages 2, 4, and 6 months.
Rotarix is administered in a 2-dose series, with doses administered at ages 2 and 4 months.
The minimum age for dose 1 of rotavirus vaccine is 6 weeks; the maximum age for dose 1 is 14 weeks and 6 days.
Vaccination should not be initiated for infants aged 15 weeks and 0 days or older because of insufficient data on safety of dose 1 of rotavirus vaccine in older infants.
The minimum interval between doses of rotavirus vaccine is 4 weeks; no maximum interval is set.
All doses should be administered by age 8 months and 0 days.
How can I heat my house safely or cook when the power is out?

What is the prognosis for Headache?
Not all headaches require medical attention.
But some types of headache are signals of more serious disorders and call for prompt medical care.
These include: sudden, severe headache or sudden headache associated with a stiff neck; headaches associated with fever, convulsions, or accompanied by confusion or loss of consciousness; headaches following a blow to the head, or associated with pain in the eye or ear; persistent headache in a person who was previously headache free; and recurring headache in children.
Migraine headaches may last a day or more and can strike as often as several times a week or as rarely as once every few years.
What is the prognosis for Whiplash?
Generally, prognosis for individuals with whiplash is good.
The neck and head pain clears within a few days or weeks.
Most patients recover within 3 months after the injury, however, some may continue to have residual neck pain and headaches.
What is Targeted therapy?
Targeted therapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells without harming normal cells.
How is narcolepsy diagnosed?
The MSLT is performed during the day to measure a person's tendency to fall asleep and to determine whether isolated elements of REM sleep intrude at inappropriate times during the waking hours.
The sleep latency test measures the amount of time it takes for a person to fall asleep.
As part of the test, an individual is asked to take four or five short naps usually scheduled 2 hours apart over the course of a day.
Because sleep latency periods are normally 12 minutes or longer, a latency period of 8 minutes or less suggests a disorder of excessive daytime sleepiness.
However, a sleep latency of 8 minutes or less can be due to many conditions other than narcolepsy.
The MSLT also measures heart and respiratory rates, records nerve activity in muscles, and pinpoints the occurrence of abnormally timed REM episodes through EEG recordings.
If a person enters REM sleep either at the beginning or within a few minutes of sleep onset during at least two of the scheduled naps, this is considered an indication of narcolepsy.
Other reasons for REM sleep on the MSLT must be ruled out, such as the effects of medication and disrupted sleep from sleep apnea or an irregular work-rest schedule.
What is Diagnosis of the disorder based on?
Diagnosis of the disorder is based on a careful clinical exam in combination with computed tomography CT or magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the brain, which may show tubers in the brain, and an ultrasound of the heart, liver, and kidneys, which may show tumors in those organs.

What are the complications of viral gastroenteritis?
Dehydration is the most common complication of viral gastroenteritis.
When someone does not drink enough fluids to replace those that are lost through vomiting and diarrhea, dehydration can result.
When dehydrated, the body does not have enough fluids to keep the proper balance of important salts or minerals, known as electrolytes.
Infants, young children, older adults, and people with weak immune systems have the greatest risk of becoming dehydrated.

The immune system normally protects people from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances.
What is Choriocarcinoma of the liver?
Choriocarcinoma of the liver is a very rare tumor that appears to originate in the placenta during gestation and presents with a liver mass in the first few months of life.
How is cerebral palsy diagnosed?
Doctors will order a series of tests to evaluate the child's motor skills.
During regular visits, the doctor will monitor the child's development, growth, muscle tone, age-appropriate motor control, hearing and vision, posture, and coordination, in order to rule out other disorders that could cause similar symptoms.
Although symptoms may change over time, CP is not progressive.
If a child is continuously losing motor skills, the problem more likely is a condition other than CP - such as a genetic or muscle disease, metabolism disorder, or tumors in the nervous system.
How can I exercise safely if I have osteoporosis?
Unfortunately, some people become so afraid of breaking another bone that they become more sedentary, which leads to further loss of bone and muscle.
Rest assured, however, that by practicing proper posture and learning the correct way to move, you can protect your bones while remaining physically active.
Every activity can be adapted to meet your age, ability, lifestyle, and strength.
Your doctor or a physical therapist can help you design a safe and effective exercise program.
In the meantime, here are some general guidelines for safe movement:

If learning problems develop, appropriate educational interventions are helpful.
What is Herpes Zoster Oticus?
Herpes zoster oticus, also called Ramsay Hunt Syndrome or Ramsay Hunt Syndrome type II, is a common complication of shingles.
Shingles is an infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus, which is the virus that causes chickenpox.
Shingles occurs in people who have had chickenpox and represents a reactivation of the dormant varicella-zoster virus.
Herpes zoster oticus, which is caused by the spread of the varicella-zoster virus to facial nerves, is characterized by intense ear pain, a rash around the ear, mouth, face, neck, and scalp, and paralysis of facial nerves.
Other symptoms may include hearing loss, vertigo abnormal sensation of movement, and tinnitus abnormal sounds.
Taste loss in the tongue and dry mouth and eyes may also occur.

Long-segment HD means most or all of the large intestine, and sometimes the last part of the small intestine, lacks nerve cells.
What is diverticular disease?
The problems that occur with diverticular disease include diverticulitis and diverticular bleeding.
Diverticulitis occurs when the diverticula become inflamed, or irritated and swollen, and infected.
Diverticular bleeding occurs when a small blood vessel within the wall of a diverticulum bursts.
Is TSC inherited?
Rarely, individuals acquire TSC through a process called gonadal mosaicism.
These patients have parents with no apparent defects in the two genes that cause the disorder.
Yet these parents can have a child with TSC because a portion of one of the parent's reproductive cells sperm or eggs can contain the genetic mutation without the other cells of the body being involved.
In cases of gonadal mosaicism, genetic testing of a blood sample might not reveal the potential for passing the disease to offspring.
What is Hemochromatosis?
Hemochromatosis is the most common form of iron overload disease.
How Can Family Members Help?

However, some workers may have symptoms such as arthritis, muscle and joint pain, or fatigue for an extended period of time.
What is the prognosis for Tourette?
Although there is no cure for TS, the condition in many individuals improves in the late teens and early 20s.
As a result, some may actually become symptom-free or no longer need medication for tic suppression.
Although the disorder is generally lifelong and chronic, it is not a degenerative condition.
Individuals with TS have a normal life expectancy.
TS does not impair intelligence.
Although tic symptoms tend to decrease with age, it is possible that neurobehavioral disorders such as ADHD, OCD, depression, generalized anxiety, panic attacks, and mood swings can persist and cause impairment in adult life.
What is the prognosis for Antiphospholipid Syndrome?
APS improves significantly with anticoagulation therapy, which reduces the risk of further clots in veins and arteries.
Treatment should be lifelong, since there is a high risk of further clots in individuals who stop warfarin treatment.
Doctors often recommend that individuals stop smoking, exercise regularly, and eat a healthy diet to prevent high blood pressure and diabetes, which are diseases that increase the risk for stroke.
Treating pregnant women with aspirin or heparin usually prevents miscarriages related to APS.
How is hearing loss treated?
If you think you have hearing loss, start by seeing a doctor.
Find out which treatment options are right for you.
What Is My Risk for Stroke?
Heart disease.
Common heart disorders can increase your risk for stroke.
For example, irregular heartbeat including atrial fibrillation which is thought to be the cause of 20% of strokes, heart valve defects, and enlarged heart chambers, can cause blood clots that may break loose and cause a stroke.
Other heart conditions, such as coronary artery disease increases your risk for stroke because plaque builds up in the arteries and blocks the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the brain.
What Is COPD?
Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of COPD.
Most people who have COPD smoke or used to smoke.
Long-term exposure to other lung irritants - such as air pollution, chemical fumes, or dust - also may contribute to COPD.
What is Behcet's Disease?
Behcet's disease is a rare, chronic inflammatory disorder.
The cause of Behcet's disease is unknown, but current research suggests that both genetic and environmental factors play a role.
Behcet's disease generally begins when individuals are in their 20s or 30s, although it can happen at any age.
It tends to occur more often in men than in women.
Symptoms of Behcet's disease include recurrent ulcers in the mouth resembling canker sores and on the genitals, and eye inflammation.
The disorder may also cause various types of skin lesions, arthritis, bowel inflammation, meningitis inflammation of the membranes of the brain and spinal cord, and cranial nerve palsies.
Behcet's is a multi-system disease; it may involve all organs and affect the central nervous system, causing memory loss and impaired speech, balance, and movement.
What is Blood pressure?
Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries as the heart pumps blood.
What is the treatment for hepatitis A?
Hepatitis A usually resolves on its own over several weeks.

Treatment is symptomatic and supportive and may include medication for movement disorders.
What is the prognosis for Acid Lipase Disease?
Infants with Wolman's disease usually die by age 1.
The onset and course of CESD varies, and individuals may live into adulthood.
What is Encephalopathy?
Encephalopathy is a term for any diffuse disease of the brain that alters brain function or structure.
Encephalopathy may be caused by infectious agent bacteria, virus, or prion, metabolic or mitochondrial dysfunction, brain tumor or increased pressure in the skull, prolonged exposure to toxic elements including solvents, drugs, radiation, paints, industrial chemicals, and certain metals, chronic progressive trauma, poor nutrition, or lack of oxygen or blood flow to the brain.
The hallmark of encephalopathy is an altered mental state.
Depending on the type and severity of encephalopathy, common neurological symptoms are progressive loss of memory and cognitive ability, subtle personality changes, inability to concentrate, lethargy, and progressive loss of consciousness.
Other neurological symptoms may include myoclonus involuntary twitching of a muscle or group of muscles, nystagmus rapid, involuntary eye movement, tremor, muscle atrophy and weakness, dementia, seizures, and loss of ability to swallow or speak.
Blood tests, spinal fluid examination, imaging studies, electroencephalograms, and similar diagnostic studies may be used to differentiate the various causes of encephalopathy.
What is Tethered spinal cord syndrome?
Tethered spinal cord syndrome is a neurological disorder caused by tissue attachments that limit the movement of the spinal cord within the spinal column.
Is there any treatment for Infantile Spasms?
Treatment with corticosteroids such as prednisone is standard, although serious side effects can occur.
Several newer antiepileptic medications, such as topiramate may ease some symptoms.
Vigabatrin Sabril has been approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration to treat infantile spasms in children ages one month to two years.
Some children have spasms as the result of brain lesions, and surgical removal of these lesions may result in improvement.

Chronic sinusitis is a condition in which the sinuses are infected or inflamed.
What is Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy CIDP?
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy CIDP is a neurological disorder characterized by progressive weakness and impaired sensory function in the legs and arms.
The disorder, which is sometimes called chronic relapsing polyneuropathy, is caused by damage to the myelin sheath the fatty covering that wraps around and protects nerve fibers of the peripheral nerves.
Although it can occur at any age and in both genders, CIDP is more common in young adults, and in men more so than women.
It often presents with symptoms that include tingling or numbness beginning in the toes and fingers, weakness of the arms and legs, loss of deep tendon reflexes areflexia, fatigue, and abnormal sensations.
CIDP is closely related to Guillain-Barre syndrome and it is considered the chronic counterpart of that acute disease.
What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Thrombocythemia and Thrombocytosis?
The signs and symptoms of a high platelet count are linked to blood clots and bleeding.
They include weakness, bleeding, headache, dizziness, chest pain, and tingling in the hands and feet.
How are these disorders treated?
Polymyositis and dermatomyositis are first treated with high doses of corticosteroid drug.
This is most often given as an oral medication but can be delivered intravenously.
Immunosuppressant drugs, such as azathioprine and methotrexate, may reduce inflammation in individuals who do not respond well to prednisone.
Periodic treatment using intravenous immunoglobulin can increase the chance for recovery in individuals with dermatomyositis or polymyositis.
Other immunosuppressive agents that may treat the inflammation associated with dermatomyositis and polymyositis include cyclosporine A, cyclophosphamide, and tacrolimus.
Physical therapy is usually recommended to prevent muscle atrophy and to regain muscle strength and range of motion.
Bed rest for an extended period of time should be avoided, as people may develop muscle atrophy, decreased muscle function, and joint contractures.
A low-sodium diet may help to counter edema and cardiovascular complications.
What is Aplastic anemia?
Aplastic anemia is a rare but serious disorder.
What are Use of NSAIDs?
Use of NSAIDs is the second most common cause of peptic ulcers.
What is the best age to give the second dose of MMR vaccine?
The second dose of MMR can be given at any time, as long as the child is at least 12 months old and it has been at least 28 days since the first dose.
However, the second dose is usually administered before the child begins kindergarten or first grade 4-5 years of age or before entry to middle school 11-12 years of age.
The age at which the second dose is required is generally mandated by state school entry requirements.
What Is Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis?
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis noo-mo-NI-tis, or HP, is a disease in which the lungs become inflamed from breathing in foreign substances, such as molds, dusts, and chemicals.
These substances also are known as antigens AN-tih-jens.
What Are the Risks of Bronchoscopy?
A rare, but more serious risk is a pneumothorax noo-mo-THOR-aks, or collapsed lung.
In this condition, air collects in the space around the lungs, which causes one or both lungs to collapse.
How Is Hypotension Diagnosed?
Hypotension is diagnosed based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results.
Your doctor will want to know:
How is hepatitis B spread?
Hepatitis B is spread through contact with infected blood, through sex with an infected person, and from mother to child during childbirth, whether the delivery is vaginal or via cesarean section.
What are the symptoms of the flu?
Although the term 'stomach flu' is sometimes used to describe vomiting, nausea, or diarrhea, these illnesses are caused by certain other viruses, bacteria, or possibly parasites, and are rarely related to influenza.
Also see Cold Versus Flu.
What is a canine influenza virus?
The 'canine influenza virus' is an influenza A H3N8 influenza virus not a human influenza virus that was originally an equine horse influenza virus.
This virus has spread to dogs and can now spread between dogs.
Q: Why is this vaccine not mandatory for school entry?
Healthcare providers do not need to wait to recommend and/or administer the HPV vaccine until there is a school requirement.
Almost every state has a Tdap requirement for middle school entry.
Providers should use this opportunity to administer HPV and meningococcal vaccines.
As we know, missed opportunities for HPV are very common and if providers would administer HPV when they give other recommended vaccines, coverage for the first dose could be as high as 93%.
How Is Angina Treated?
Lifestyle changes and medicines may be the only treatments needed if your symptoms are mild and aren't getting worse.
If lifestyle changes and medicines don't control angina, you may need medical procedures or cardiac rehab.
How common is porphyria?
The exact rates of porphyria are unknown and vary around the world.
For example, porphyria cutanea tarda is most common in the United States, and variegate porphyria is most common in South America.

What is Manometry?
Manometry is a test that measures muscle pressure and movements in the GI tract, such as how well the smooth muscles of the stomach and small intestine contract and relax.
What causes spina bifida?
The exact cause of spina bifida remains a mystery.
No one knows what disrupts complete closure of the neural tube, causing this malformation to develop.
Scientists suspect the factors that cause spina bifida are multiple: genetic, nutritional, and environmental factors all play a role.
Research studies indicate that insufficient intake of folic acid - a common B vitamin - in the mother's diet is a key factor in causing spina bifida and other neural tube defects.
Prenatal vitamins typically contain folic acid as well as other vitamins.
See 'Can the disorder be prevented?' for more information on folic acid..
What is the prognosis for Inclusion Body Myositis?
IBM is generally resistant to all therapies and its rate of progression appears to be unaffected by currently available treatments.
How is NF1 treated?
Scientists don't know how to prevent neurofibromas from growing.
Surgery is often recommended to remove tumors that become symptomatic and may become cancerous, as well as for tumors that cause significant cosmetic disfigurement.
Several surgical options exist, but there is no general agreement among doctors about when surgery should be performed or which surgical option is best.
Individuals considering surgery should carefully weigh the risks and benefits of all their options to determine which treatment is right for them.
Treatment for neurofibromas that become malignant may include surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy.
Surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy may also be used to control or reduce the size of optic nerve gliomas when vision is threatened.
Some bone malformations, such as scoliosis, can be corrected surgically.
What is Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum?
Agenesis of the corpus callosum ACC is a birth defect in which the structure that connects the two hemispheres of the brain the corpus callosum is partially or completely absent.
ACC can occur as an isolated condition or in combination with other cerebral abnormalities, including Arnold-Chiari malformation, Dandy-Walker syndrome, Andermann syndrome, schizencephaly clefts or deep divisions in brain tissue, and holoprosencephaly failure of the forebrain to divide into lobes.
Girls may have a gender-specific condition called Aicardi's syndrome, which causes severe mental retardation, seizures, abnormalities in the vertebra of the spine, and lesions on the retina of the eye.
ACC can also be associated with malformations in other parts of the body, such as midline facial defects.
The effects of the disorder range from subtle or mild to severe, depending on associated brain abnormalities.
Intelligence may be normal with mild compromise of skills requiring matching of visual patterns.
But children with the most severe brain malformations may have intellectual retardation, seizures, hydrocephalus, and spasticity.
What is bleeding in the digestive tract?
Bleeding in the digestive tract is any type of bleeding that starts in the digestive tract.
Bleeding in the digestive tract is a symptom of a disease rather than a disease itself.
Health care providers describe two types of bleeding:
What Is Fanconi Anemia?
Although FA is a blood disorder, it also can affect many of your body's organs, tissues, and systems.
Children who inherit FA are at higher risk of being born with birth defects.
FA also increases the risk of some cancers and other serious health problems.
Who is at risk for encephalitis and meningitis?
Anyone can get encephalitis or meningitis.
People with weakened immune systems, including those persons with HIV or those taking immunosuppressant drugs, are at the highest risk of contracting the diseases.
What is the prognosis for Spinal?
The prognosis is poor for babies with SMA Type I.
Most die within the first two years.
For children with SMA Type II, the prognosis for life expectancy or for independent standing or walking roughly correlates with how old they are when they first begin to experience symptoms - older children tend to have less severe symptoms.
Some children may have a normal life expectancy and learn to walk with the aid of a brace.
Others may die from respiratory infections, such as pneumonia.
Children with onset after 18 months are often able to walk and are fully functional for years before they need assistance.
They may have a normal life expectancy.
How do I know if I'm having a stroke?
Stroke is a medical emergency.
Call 911 right away if you or someone else has signs of stroke.
Your chances of survival and recovery from a stroke are better if you get emergency treatment immediately.
What causes Machado-Joseph Disease?
MJD is classified as one of many dominantly inherited ataxias, specifically the spinocerebellar ataxias or SCAs.
In the SCAs, of which nearly 30 separate genetic causes have been identified, degeneration of cells in the hindbrain leads to impaired coordination of movement.
The hindbrain includes the cerebellum a large bundle of brain tissue resembling a bun located at the back of the head, the brain stem, and the upper part of the spinal cord.
MJD is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that an affected person has a single disease-causing MJD allele an allele is half of a pair of genes located at the same position on a person's chromosomes and a normal MJD allele, and can pass on either allele to the next generation.
Any child of an affected parent has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the disease allele.
If the child inherits the disease-causing gene, he or she will eventually develop symptoms of the disease.
A child who does not inherit the disease allele will not develop the disease and cannot pass it on to the next generation.
What research is being done for Cerebro-Oculo-Facio-Skeletal?
The NINDS supports research on genetic disorders such as COFS.
The goals of this research include finding ways to prevent, treat, and cure these disorders.
How is the Fluzone High-Dose vaccine available?
This vaccine is approved for marketing in 0.5 mL preservative-free, single dose, prefilled syringes.
What is the prognosis for Neurotoxicity?
The prognosis depends upon the length and degree of exposure and the severity of neurological injury.
In some instances, exposure to neurotoxicants can be fatal.
In others, patients may survive but not fully recover.
In other situations, many individuals recover completely after treatment.

What should you expect before a Blood Transfusion?
Before a blood transfusion, a technician tests your blood to find out your blood type A, B, AB, or O and whether you're Rh-positive or Rh-negative.
He or she pricks your finger with a needle to get a few drops of blood or draws blood from one of your veins.
What causes proctitis?
Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.
Two forms of inflammatory bowel disease IBD - ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease - can cause proctitis.
Ulcerative colitis causes irritation and ulcers, also called sores, in the inner lining of the colon - part of the large intestine - and rectum.
Crohn's disease usually causes irritation in the lower small intestine - also called the ileum - or the colon, but it can affect any part of the GI tract.
Who's at risk?
As pedestrians, children are at even greater risk of injury or death from traffic crashes due to their small size, inability to judge distances and speeds, and lack of experience with traffic rules.
Who Is More Likely to Develop Kidney Disease?
And more than 35% of adults with diabetes have chronic kidney disease.
High blood sugar blood glucose and high blood pressure increase the risk that chronic kidney disease will eventually lead to kidney failure.
If you have diabetes, controlling your blood sugar and blood pressure reduces the risk of developing kidney disease or may delay it.
What research is being done for Alpers' Disease?
The NINDS supports research on gene-linked neurodegenerative disorders such as Alpers' disease.
The goals of this research are to increase scientific understanding of these disorders, and to find ways to prevent, treat, and cure them.
What Research is Being Done?
The NINDS conducts and supports an extensive research program of basic science to increase understanding of how the nervous system works and what causes the system to sometimes go awry, leading to dysfunction.
Part of this research program focuses on learning more about the circumstances that lead to nerve damage and the conditions that cause injuries and damage to nerves.
Knowledge gained from this research may help scientists find the definitive cause of Bell's palsy, leading to the discovery of new effective treatments for the disorder.
Other NINDS-supported research is aimed at developing methods to repair damaged nerves and restore full use and strength to injured areas, and finding ways to prevent nerve damage and injuries from occurring.
How is BMI used with children and teens?
For children, BMI is used to screen for obesity, overweight, healthy weight, or underweight.
However, BMI is not a diagnostic tool.
For example, a child may have a high BMI for age and sex, but to determine if excess fat is a problem, a health care provider would need to perform further assessments.
These assessments might include skinfold thickness measurements, evaluations of diet, physical activity, family history, and other appropriate health screenings.
As an adult, do I need this vaccine?
Most adults do not need polio vaccine because they were already vaccinated as children.
But three groups of adults are at higher risk and should consider polio vaccination in the following situations:
What is Iron-deficiency anemia?
Iron-deficiency anemia is a common, easily treated condition that occurs if you don't have enough iron in your body.

Incidence Chordoma is a very rare tumor of bone that arises from remnants of the notochord within the clivus, spinal vertebrae, or sacrum.
Who Is at Risk for an Arrhythmia?
Some types of arrhythmia happen more often in children and young adults.
Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia PSVT, including Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, is more common in young people.
PSVT is a fast heart rate that begins and ends suddenly.
What is Metastasis?
Metastasis is the spread of cancer from the primary site place where it started to other places in the body.
Who is recommended for vaccination?
Everyone who is at least 6 months of age should get a flu vaccine this season.
This recommendation has been in place since February 24, 2010 when CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ACIP voted for 'universal' flu vaccination in the United States to expand protection against the flu to more people.
What is the prognosis for Spasticity?
The prognosis for those with spasticity depends on the severity of the spasticity and the associated disorders.
What is the prognosis for Metachromatic Leukodystrophy?
The prognosis for MLD is poor.
Most children within the infantile form die by age 5.
Symptoms of the juvenile form progress with death occurring 10 to 20 years following onset.
Those persons affected by the adult form typically die withing 6 to 14 years following onset of symptoms.
Who Treats It?
Treating juvenile arthritis often requires a team approach, encompassing the child and his or her family and a number of different health professionals.
Ideally, the child's care should be managed by a pediatric rheumatologist, who is a doctor who has been specially trained to treat the rheumatic diseases in children.
However, many pediatricians and 'adult' rheumatologists also treat children with juvenile arthritis.
Because there are relatively few pediatric rheumatologists and they are mainly concentrated at major medical centers in metropolitan areas, children who live in smaller towns and rural areas may benefit from having a doctor in their town coordinate care through a pediatric rheumatologist.
Many large centers now conduct outreach clinics, in which doctors and a supporting team travel from large cities to smaller towns for 1 or 2 days to treat local patients.
How is HD Diagnosed?
The physician may ask the individual to undergo a brain imaging test.
Computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI provide excellent images of brain structures with little if any discomfort.
Those with HD may show shrinkage of some parts of the brain - particularly two areas known as the caudate nuclei and putamen - and enlargement of fluid-filled cavities within the brain called ventricles.
These changes do not definitely indicate HD, however, because they can also occur in other disorders.
In addition, a person can have early symptoms of HD and still have a normal CT scan.
When used in conjunction with a family history and record of clinical symptoms, however, CT can be an important diagnostic tool.
Is It Possible to Get Too Much Exercise?
For most people, including children and teens, the challenge is to get enough physical activity.
However, excessive exercise and overtraining, often coupled with restrictive eating, can be a problem, especially for some female athletes and dancers, as well as girls who become obsessive about weight loss.
Overtraining, like eating disorders, can result in decreased estrogen and eventually lead to thin bones that break easily.
My Son Has Asthma and Takes a Steroid Medication to Control It.
His Doctor Said This Might Affect His Bones.
Is There Anything We Can Do About This?
Kids with asthma need to take special care of their bones, making sure to get enough calcium and weight-bearing exercise.
Some health care providers recommend extra calcium each day.
Many people think milk and dairy products - great sources of calcium and vitamin D - trigger asthma attacks, but this is probably true only if your child is allergic to dairy foods.
Unfortunately, this misconception often results in an unnecessary avoidance of dairy products, which is concerning, especially during the bone-building years.
What is the prognosis for Restless Legs Syndrome?
RLS is generally a life-long condition for which there is no cure.
Symptoms may gradually worsen with age.
Nevertheless, current therapies can control the disorder, minimizing symptoms and increasing periods of restful sleep.
In addition, some individuals have remissions, periods in which symptoms decrease or disappear for days, weeks, or months, although symptoms usually eventually reappear.

What is the prognosis for Hereditary Neuropathies?
The prognosis for individuals with hereditary neuropathies depends upon the type of neuropathy.
Some hereditary neuropathies have very mild symptoms and may go undiagnosed for many years.
Other types are more severe and are associated with more disabilities.
Genetic counseling is important to understand further details about the disease and prognosis.
What side effects have pregnant women experienced from the seasonal flu shot?
The most common side effects after flu shots are mild, such as being sore and tender and/or red and swollen where the shot was given.
Some people might have headache, muscle aches, fever, and nausea or feel tired.
If these problems happen, they usually begin soon after the shot is given and may last as long as 1-2 days.
Some people may faint after getting any shot.
Sometimes, flu shots can cause serious problems like severe allergic reactions.
But, life-threatening allergic reactions to vaccines are very rare.
A person who has a severe life-threatening allergy to eggs or to anything else in the vaccine should not get the shot, even if she is pregnant.
Pregnant women should tell the person giving the shots if they have any severe allergies or if they have ever had a severe allergic reaction following a flu shot.
What is Sleep apnea?
Sleep apnea is a common disorder in which you have one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep.

How Is Blood Pressure Tested?
Most often, you will sit or lie down with the cuff around your arm as your doctor or nurse checks your blood pressure.
If he or she doesn't tell you what your blood pressure numbers are, you should ask.
Who is at greatest risk from wildfire smoke?
People who have heart or lung diseases, like congestive heart failure, angina, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease including emphysema, or asthma, are at higher risk from wildfire smoke.
In general, people with these conditions are at higher risk of having health problems than healthy people.
Why is folic acid important?
Getting enough folic acid is important even when you aren't planning to get pregnant.
It's needed during the first few weeks of pregnancy, often before a woman knows she's pregnant.
Who Is at Risk for Coronary Microvascular Disease?
Studies have shown that women are more likely than men to have coronary microvascular disease MVD.
Women at high risk for the disease often have multiple risk factors for atherosclerosis.
For a detailed list of these risk factors, go to What Causes Coronary Microvascular Disease?.
Who Is at Risk for Hemochromatosis?
Alcoholism is another risk factor for hemochromatosis.
A family history of certain diseases and conditions also puts you at higher risk for hemochromatosis.
Examples of such diseases and conditions include heart attack, liver disease, diabetes, arthritis, and erectile dysfunction impotence.
What research is being done for Neuroacanthocytosis?
The NINDS supports research on disorders such as neuroacanthocytosis, aimed at increasing scientific understanding of the disorders and finding ways to prevent and treat them.
The genetic mutations responsible for some types of neuroacanthocytosis have recently been identified.
Researchers are examining the role of the basal ganglia in neuroacanthocytosis and hope to correlate the specific genetic abnormalities with the clinical features of the disease.
Other research is aimed at identifying possible causes of sudden death related to heart muscle abnormalities, which are observed in some individuals with neuroacanthocytosis.
How is PPS diagnosed?
Polio survivors with new symptoms resembling PPS should consider seeking treatment from a physician trained in neuromuscular disorders.
It is important to clearly establish the origin and potential causes for declining strength and to assess progression of weakness not explained by other health problems.
Magnetic resonance imaging MRI and computed tomography CT of the spinal cord, electrophysiological studies, and other tests are frequently used to investigate the course of decline in muscle strength and exclude other diseases that could be causing or contributing to the new progressive symptoms.
A muscle biopsy or a spinal fluid analysis can be used to exclude other, possibly treatable, conditions that mimic PPS.
Polio survivors may acquire other illnesses and should always have regular check-ups and preventive diagnostic tests.
However, there is no diagnostic test for PPS, nor is there one that can identify which polio survivors are at greatest risk.
What is Migraine?
The pain of a migraine headache is often described as an intense pulsing or throbbing pain in one area of the head.
However, it is much more; the International Headache Society diagnoses a migraine by its pain and number of attacks at least 5, lasting 4-72 hours if untreated, and additional symptoms including nausea and/or vomiting, or sensitivity to both light and sound.
Migraine is three times more common in women than in men and affects more than 10 percent of people worldwide.
Roughly one-third of affected individuals can predict the onset of a migraine because it is preceded by an aura, visual disturbances that appear as flashing lights, zig-zag lines or a temporary loss of vision.
People with migraine tend to have recurring attacks triggered by a number of different factors, including stress, anxiety, hormonal changes, bright or flashing lights, lack of food or sleep, and dietary substances.
Migraine in some women may relate to changes in hormones and hormonal levels during their menstrual cycle.
For many years, scientists believed that migraines were linked to the dilation and constriction of blood vessels in the head.
Investigators now believe that migraine has a genetic cause.
Why are blood banks now screening for Chagas disease?
The transmission of Chagas disease via blood transfusion is a recognized risk.
Screening tests recently have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
Screening for Chagas disease makes the blood supply even safer for everyone.

Pernicious anemia is a type of anemia.
What Can I Do if I Suspect a Friend May Have Some of These Signs?
First, be supportive.
Approach your friend or teammate carefully, and be sensitive.
She probably won't appreciate a lecture about how she should be taking better care of herself.
But maybe you could share a copy of this fact sheet with her or suggest that she talk to a trainer, coach, or doctor about the symptoms she's experiencing.
What is A syndrome?
A syndrome is a medical condition characterized by a collection of symptoms what the patient feels and signs what a doctor can observe or measure.
What is Asthma AZ-ma?
Asthma AZ-ma is a chronic long-term lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways.
What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis?
The signs and symptoms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis IPF develop over time.
They may not even begin to appear until the disease has done serious damage to your lungs.
Once they occur, they're likely to get worse over time.
What is Aerobic exercise?
Aerobic exercise is the type that gets your heart pumping faster and keeps your heart rate elevated for a while.
What causes the mucolipidoses?
Patients with ML are born with a genetic defect in which their bodies either do not produce enough enzymes or, in some instances, produce ineffective forms of enzymes.
Without functioning enzymes, which are proteins, lysosomes cannot break down carbohydrates and lipids and transport them to their normal destination.
The molecules then accumulate in the cells of various tissues in the body, leading to sdamage of organs.
In patients with ML, the molecules accumulate in nerve, liver, and muscle tissue as well as in bone marrow, and this abnormal storage causes the various symptoms associated with ML.
For example, excess storage of these molecules in nerve tissues can cause mental retardation, accumulation in the tissues of the spleen and liver can cause poor functioning of these vital organs, and excess storage in the bone marrow can damage bones, leading to skeletal deformities.
What is Primary Lateral Sclerosis?
Primary lateral sclerosis PLS is a rare neuromuscular disease with slowly progressive weakness in voluntary muscle movement.
PLS belongs to a group of disorders known as motor neuron diseases.
PLS affects the upper motor neurons also called corticospinal neurons in the arms, legs, and face.
It occurs when nerve cells in the motor regions of the cerebral cortex the thin layer of cells covering the brain which is responsible for most higher level mental functions gradually degenerate, causing movements to be slow and effortful.
The disorder often affects the legs first, followed by the body, trunk, arms and hands, and, finally the bulbar muscles muscles that control speech, swallowing, and chewing.
Symptoms include weakness, muscle stiffness and spasticity, clumsiness, slowing of movement, and problems with balance and speech.
PLS is more common in men than in women, with a varied gradual onset that generally occurs between ages 40 and 60.
PLS progresses gradually over a number of years, or even decades.
Scientists do not believe PLS has a simple hereditary cause.
The diagnosis of PLS requires extensive testing to exclude other diseases.
When symptoms begin, PLS may be mistaken for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS or spastic paraplegia.
Most neurologists follow an affected individual's clinical course for at least 3 to 4 years before making a diagnosis of PLS.
What is Autoimmune hepatitis?
Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic - or long lasting - disease in which the body's immune system attacks the normal components, or cells, of the liver and causes inflammation and liver damage.
What is the prognosis for Megalencephaly?
The prognosis for infants and children with megalencephaly depends upon the underlying cause and the associated neurological disorders.
The prognosis for children with hemimegalencephaly is poor.
What Is Osteoporosis?
Osteoporosis often can be prevented.
It is known as a silent disease because, if undetected, it can progress for many years without symptoms until a fracture occurs.
Osteoporosis has been called a childhood disease with consequences in old age because building healthy bones in youth helps prevent the disease and fractures later in life.
However, it is never too late to adopt new habits for healthy bones.
What is the state of the science involving narcolepsy?
Many other genes besides those making up the HLA complex and the T-cell receptor may contribute to the development of narcolepsy.
Groups of neurons in several parts of the brain stem and the central brain, including the thalamus and hypothalamus, interact to control sleep.
Large numbers of genes on different chromosomes control these neurons' activities, any of which could contribute to the development of the disease.
Scientists studying narcolepsy in dogs have identified a mutation that appears to cause the disorder in Dobermans, Labradors, and Dachshunds.
This mutated gene disrupts the ability to receive the signal from hypocretins also known as orexins that are produced by neurons located in the hypothalamus.
The neurons that produce hypocretins are active during wakefulness, and research suggests that they keep the brain systems needed for wakefulness from shutting down unexpectedly.
Mice born without functioning hypocretin genes develop symptoms of narcolepsy.
What are the symptoms?
Although the sequence of emerging symptoms and the rate of disease progression vary from person to person, eventually individuals will not be able to stand or walk, get in or out of bed on their own, or use their hands and arms.
Difficulty swallowing and chewing impair the person's ability to eat normally and increase the risk of choking.
Maintaining weight will then become a problem.
Because cognitive abilities are relatively intact, people are aware of their progressive loss of function and may become anxious and depressed.
A small percentage of individuals may experience problems with memory or decision-making, and there is growing evidence that some may even develop a form of dementia over time.
Health care professionals need to explain the course of the disease and describe available treatment options so that people can make informed decisions in advance.
In later stages of the disease, individuals have difficulty breathing as the muscles of the respiratory system weaken.
They eventually lose the ability to breathe on their own and must depend on ventilatory support for survival.
Affected individuals also face an increased risk of pneumonia during later stages of ALS.
What's the difference between confidential and anonymous testing?
When you get tested at a doctor's office or clinic, your test results are confidential.
This means they can only be shared with people allowed to see your medical records.
Who gets Rett syndrome?
The story is different for boys who have a MECP2 mutation known to cause Rett syndrome in girls.
Because boys have only one X chromosome and one Y chromosome they lack a back-up copy that could compensate for the defective one, and they have no protection from the harmful effects of the disorder.
Boys with such a defect frequently do not show clinical features of Rett syndrome but experience severe problems when they are first born and die shortly after birth.
A very small number of boys may have a different mutation in the MECP2 gene or a sporadic mutation after conception that can cause some degree of intellectual disability and developmental problems.
What is the prognosis for Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease?
The prognosis for those with the severe forms of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease is poor, with progressive deterioration until death.
On the other end of the disease spectrum, individuals with the mild form, in which spastic paraplegia is the chief symptom, may have nearly normal activity and life span.
Is the number of people in the United States being hospitalized for seasonal flu complications each year increasing?
The results of a study conducted by CDC and published in the Journal of American Medical Association JAMA in September 2004 indicated an overall increasing trend in the number of seasonal flu-related hospitalizations in the United States each year.
The study looked at hospital records from 1979 to 2001.
In 1979, there were 120,929 flu-related hospitalizations.
The number was lower in some years after that, but there was an overall upward trend.
During the 1990s, the average number of people hospitalized was over 200,000 but individual seasons ranged from a low of 157,911 in 1990-91 to a high of 430,960 in 1997-98.
What is the prognosis for Progressive?
PSP gets progressively worse but is not itself directly life-threatening.
It does, however, predispose individuals to serious complications such as pneumonia secondary to difficulty in swallowing dysphagia.
The most common complications are choking and pneumonia, head injury, and fractures caused by falls.
The most common cause of death is pneumonia.
With good attention to medical and nutritional needs, it is possible for most individuals with PSP to live a decade or more after the first symptoms of the disease.
What is Schizencephaly?
Schizencephaly is an extremely rare developmental birth defect characterized by abnormal slits, or clefts, in the cerebral hemispheres of the brain.
What research is being done for Olivopontocerebellar Atrophy?
The NINDS supports and conducts a broad range of basic and clinical research on cerebellar degeneration, including work aimed at finding the causes of OPCA and ways to treat, cure, and, ultimately, prevent the disease.
There has been great progress recently since the genes for several of the hereditary forms of OPCA have been found.
How Is Tetralogy of Fallot Diagnosed?
Signs and symptoms of the heart defect usually occur during the first weeks of life.
Your infant's doctor may notice signs or symptoms during a routine checkup.
Some parents also notice cyanosis or poor feeding and bring the baby to the doctor.
Cyanosis is a bluish tint to the skin, lips, and fingernails..
What is Whiplash?
Whiplash-a soft tissue injury to the neck-is also called neck sprain or neck strain.
It is characterized by a collection of symptoms that occur following damage to the neck, usually because of sudden extension and flexion.
The disorder commonly occurs as the result of an automobile accident and may include injury to intervertebral joints, discs, and ligaments, cervical muscles, and nerve roots.
Symptoms such as neck pain may be present directly after the injury or may be delayed for several days.
In addition to neck pain, other symptoms may include neck stiffness, injuries to the muscles and ligaments myofascial injuries, headache, dizziness, abnormal sensations such as burning or prickling paresthesias, or shoulder or back pain.
In addition, some people experience cognitive, somatic, or psychological conditions such as memory loss, concentration impairment, nervousness/irritability, sleep disturbances, fatigue, or depression.
Who can receive the intradermal flu vaccine?
Fluzone Intradermal is approved for use in adults aged 18 through 64 years of age.
What Are the Risks of Cardiac MRI?
If your cardiac MRI includes a stress test, more medicines will be used during the test.
These medicines may have other side effects that aren't expected during a regular MRI scan, such as:
Is there any treatment for Foot Drop?
Treatment depends on the specific cause of foot drop.
The most common treatment is to support the foot with light-weight leg braces and shoe inserts, called ankle-foot orthotics.
Exercise therapy to strengthen the muscles and maintain joint motion also helps to improve gait.
Devices that electrically stimulate the peroneal nerve during footfall are appropriate for a small number of individuals with foot drop.
In cases with permanent loss of movement, surgery that fuses the foot and ankle joint or that transfers tendons from stronger leg muscles is occasionally performed.
How can Wilson disease be prevented?
A person cannot prevent Wilson disease; however, people with a family history of Wilson disease, especially those with an affected sibling or parent, should talk with a health care provider about testing.
A health care provider may be able to diagnose Wilson disease before symptoms appear.
Early diagnosis and treatment of Wilson disease can reduce or even prevent organ damage.

What causes Meningitis?
Meningitis is most often caused by a bacterial infection.
What research is being done for Antiphospholipid Syndrome?
The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health NIH support research on APS through grants to major medical institutions across the country.
NINDS is currently funding a clinical trial looking at the effectiveness of warfarin versus aspirin treatment in reducing recurrent strokes in individuals with APS.
NINDS is also funding efforts to find additional indicators in the blood, such as certain antibodies, that could help doctors more accurately predict an individual's risk for recurrent stroke.
What Is Type I OI?
Nearly all cases of OI, mild or severe, are caused by a dominant genetic mutation that affects the body's production of type 1 collagen.
Although the body produces several types of collagen, only type 1 collagen has been associated with OI.
Type 1 collagen, the main protein building block in bone, is also important in other connective tissues such as tendons and ligaments.
When there is a problem with the body's production of type 1 collagen, the bones are brittle and break more easily.
What is Hysterectomy?
Hysterectomy is the standard treatment for patients with adenocarcinoma in situ.
What is Hypertonia?
Hypertonia is a condition in which there is too much muscle tone so that arms or legs, for example, are stiff and difficult to move.
Muscle tone is regulated by signals that travel from the brain to the nerves and tell the muscle to contract.
Hypertonia happens when the regions of the brain or spinal cord that control these signals are damaged.
This can occur for many reasons, such as a blow to the head, stroke, brain tumors, toxins that affect the brain, neurodegenerative processes such as in multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease, or neurodevelopmental abnormalities such as in cerebral palsy.
What is A stool test?
A stool test is the analysis of a sample of stool.
How can I protect my baby from hepatitis B?
Getting tested for hepatitis B is especially important for pregnant women.
If you are not infected, get the vaccine.
If you have hepatitis B, make sure the doctor and staff that deliver your baby know so they can minimize your baby's risk of infection.
The hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin should be given to your baby immediately after birth, greatly reducing the chance of infection.
How do I know if I have hearing loss?
If you answered yes to some of these questions, you may have hearing loss.
Take this quiz to find out if you might have a hearing problem.
What Are the Risks of Echocardiography?
Stress echo has some risks, but they're related to the exercise or medicine used to raise your heart rate, not the echo.
Serious complications from stress tests are very uncommon.
Go to the Health Topics Stress Testing article for more information about the risks of that test.
What Are the Treatable Risk Factors?
Some of the most important treatable risk factors for stroke are:
How should blood spills be cleaned from surfaces to make sure that Hepatitis C virus is gone?
Any blood spills - including dried blood, which can still be infectious - should be cleaned using a dilution of one part household bleach to 10 parts water.
Gloves should be worn when cleaning up blood spills.
What is Monkeypox?
Monkeypox is a rare viral disease that occurs mainly in the rain forest countries of central and west Africa.
How Is Hemochromatosis Treated?
Treatments for hemochromatosis include therapeutic phlebotomy fleh-BOT-o-me, iron chelation ke-LAY-shun therapy, dietary changes, and treatment for complications.
What research is being done for Batten?
Studying the lipopigment deposits that contain fats and proteins, one NINDS-supported scientist, using animal models of NCL, found that a large portion of this built-up material is a protein called subunit c.
This protein is normally found inside the cell's mitochondria, small structures that produce the energy cells need to do their jobs.
Scientists are now working to understand what role this protein may play in NCL, including how this protein accumulates inside diseased cell and whether its accumulation - or the accumulation of other components in the storage material - is harmful to the cell.
An important aspect of these studies is looking at how the different gene mutations lead to the lipoprotein deposits, which may involve the same processes.
What research is being done for Infantile Neuroaxonal Dystrophy?
Researchers continue to search for the defective gene that causes INAD in hopes of developing drugs that can stop the disease.
The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS conducts research related to INAD in its laboratories at the National Institutes of Health NIH, and also supports additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country.
Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure disorders such as INAD.
What is Continent ileostomy?
Continent ileostomy is an option for people who are not good candidates for ileoanal reservoir surgery because of damage to the rectum or anus but do not want to wear an ostomy pouch
What Is Coronary Microvascular Disease?
Plaque narrows the heart's large arteries and reduces the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle.
The buildup of plaque also makes it more likely that blood clots will form in your arteries.
Blood clots can mostly or completely block blood flow through a coronary artery.
How Can Heart Disease Be Prevented?
Following a healthy diet also is an important part of a healthy lifestyle.
A healthy diet includes a variety of vegetables and fruits.
It also includes whole grains, fat-free or low-fat dairy products, and protein foods, such as lean meats, poultry without skin, seafood, processed soy products, nuts, seeds, beans, and peas.
What is primary sclerosing cholangitis PSC?
In PSC, inflammation of the bile ducts leads to scar formation and narrowing of the ducts over time.
As scarring increases, the ducts become blocked.
As a result, bile builds up in the liver and damages liver cells.
Eventually, scar tissue can spread throughout the liver, causing cirrhosis and liver failure.
Can appendicitis be treated without surgery?
Nonsurgical treatment may be used if surgery is not available, a person is not well enough to undergo surgery, or the diagnosis is unclear.
Nonsurgical treatment includes antibiotics to treat infection.
What is A mammogram?
A mammogram is an x-ray of the breast.
What is Chemotherapy?
Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing.
Is there any treatment for Thoracic Outlet Syndrome?
Treatment begins with exercise programs and physical therapy to strengthen chest muscles, restore normal posture, and relieve compression by increasing the space of the area the nerve passes through.
Doctors will often prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as naproxen or ibuprofen for pain.
Other medicines include thromobolytics to break up blood clots and anticoagulants to prevent clots.
If this doesn't relieve pain, a doctor may recommend thoracic outlet decompression surgery to release or remove the structures causing compression of the nerve or artery.
Will this study find a prevention/cure for autism?
It is too soon to speculate on what we might find about the risk factors of autism.
But, we are hopeful that the findings from SEED will help the development of future studies specifically designed to assess treatments among children with autism.
What causes porphyria?
Most porphyrias are inherited disorders.
Scientists have identified genes for all eight enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway.
Most porphyrias result from inheriting an abnormal gene, also called a gene mutation, from one parent.
Some porphyrias, such as congenital erythropoietic porphyria, hepatoerythropoietic porphyria, and erythropoietic protoporphyria, occur when a person inherits two abnormal genes, one from each parent.
The likeliness of a person passing the abnormal gene or genes to the next generation depends on the type of porphyria.
What are the different categories of tremor?
Essential tremor sometimes called benign essential tremor is the most common of the forms of abnormal tremor.
Although the tremor may be mild and nonprogressive in some people over a long period of time, in others, the tremor is slowly progressive, starting on one side of the body but affecting both sides within a few years.
The hands are most often affected but the head, voice, tongue, legs, and trunk may also be involved, typically to a lesser extend than the hands.
Tremor of the hands is typically present as an action tremor.
Head tremor may be seen as a 'yes-yes' or 'no-no' motion.
Essential tremor may be accompanied by mild gait disturbance.
Tremor frequency may decrease as the person ages, but the severity may increase, affecting the person's ability to perform certain tasks or activities of daily living.
Heightened emotion, stress, fever, physical exhaustion, or low blood sugar may trigger tremors and/or increase their severity.
Onset is most common after age 40, although symptoms can appear at any age.
It may occur in more than one family member.
Children of a parent who has essential tremor have a 50 percent chance of inheriting the condition.
A variant in the gene LINGO1 has been identified as a risk gene, although not all individuals with essential tremor carry this variant--which also can be present in people without essential tremor.
While essential tremor was thought not to be associated with any known pathology over many years, recent studies suggest that there is a mild degeneration of certain parts of the cerebellum in individuals with essential tremor.
Why should pregnant women get the seasonal flu vaccine?
To prevent influenza and complications in pregnant women, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ACIP in 2004 began recommending routine immunization of pregnant women with the flu shot at any stage of pregnancy.
The nasal spray vaccine is not recommended for use in pregnant women.
More information on the ACIP recommendations for influenza vaccination during the 2013-2014 season.
Q: Who should get HPV vaccine?
A: All kids who are 11 or 12 years old should get the three dose series of HPV vaccine.
Teen boys and girls who did not get the vaccine when they were younger should get it now.
Young women can get HPV vaccine through age 26, and young men can get vaccinated through age 21.
The vaccine is also recommended for gay and bisexual young men or any young man who has sex with men and also for young men with compromised immune systems including HIV through age 26, if they did not get HPV vaccine when they were younger.
What is the prognosis for Whipple's Disease?
Generally, antibiotic treatment to destroy the bacteria that caused the disease results in relief of symptoms.
However, the disorder may be persistent despite sustained treatment with antibiotics.
Relapses are frequent.
With treatment, the disorder can be cured.
Untreated, Whipple's disease is fatal.
What is the prognosis for Ataxia Telangiectasia?
Average lifespan has been improving for years, for unknown reasons, and varies with the severity of the underlying mutations, ATM ataxia-telangiectasia mutated protein levels, and residual ATM kinase activity.
Some individuals with later onset of disease and slower progression survive into their 50s.
Why are human infections with variant viruses of concern?
Influenza viruses that infect pigs are different from human influenza viruses.
Thus, influenza vaccines made against human influenza viruses are generally not expected to protect people from influenza viruses that normally circulate in pigs.
In addition, because pigs are susceptible to avian, human and swine influenza viruses, they potentially may be infected with influenza viruses from different species e.g., ducks and humans at the same time.
If this happens, it is possible for the genes of these viruses to mix and create a new virus that could spread easily from person-to-person.
This type of major change in the influenza A viruses is known as antigenic shift.
Antigenic shift results when a new influenza A virus to which most people have little or no immune protection infects humans.
If this new virus causes illness in people and can be transmitted easily from person-to-person, an influenza pandemic can occur.
This is what happened in 2009 when an influenza A H1N1 virus with swine, avian and human genes emerged in the spring of 2009 and caused the first pandemic in more than 40 years.
What causes autism?
Scientists aren't certain about what causes ASD, but it's likely that both genetics and environment play a role.
Researchers have identified a number of genes associated with the disorder.
Studies of people with ASD have found irregularities in several regions of the brain.
Other studies suggest that people with ASD have abnormal levels of serotonin or other neurotransmitters in the brain.
These abnormalities suggest that ASD could result from the disruption of normal brain development early in fetal development caused by defects in genes that control brain growth and that regulate how brain cells communicate with each other, possibly due to the influence of environmental factors on gene function.
While these findings are intriguing, they are preliminary and require further study.
The theory that parental practices are responsible for ASD has long been disproved.
What is Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker Disease?
Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease GSS is an extremely rare, neurodegenerative brain disorder.
It is almost always inherited and is found in only a few families around the world.
Onset of the disease usually occurs between the ages of 35 and 55.
In the early stages, patients may experience varying levels of ataxia lack of muscle coordination, including clumsiness, unsteadiness, and difficulty walking.
As the disease progresses, the ataxia becomes more pronounced and most patients develop dementia.
Other symptoms may include dysarthria slurring of speech, nystagmus involuntary movements of the eyes, spasticity rigid muscle tone, and visual disturbances, sometimes leading to blindness.
Deafness also can occur.
In some families, parkinsonian features are present.
GSS belongs to a family of human and animal diseases known as the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies TSEs.
Other TSEs include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, kuru, and fatal familial insomnia.
What research is being done for Carpal?
The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS, a part of the National Institutes of Health, is the federal government's leading supporter of biomedical research on neuropathy, including carpal tunnel syndrome.
Another NIH component, the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Disorders NIAMS, supports research on tissue damage associated with repetitive motion disorders, including carpal tunnel syndrome.
Scientists supported by the NINDS are studying the factors that lead to long-lasting neuropathies, and how the affected nerves are related to symptoms of pain, numbness, and functional loss.
Researchers also are examining biomechanical stresses that contribute to the nerve damage responsible for symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome in order to better understand, treat, and prevent this ailment.
By quantifying the distinct biomechanical pressures from fluid and anatomical structures, researchers are finding ways to limit or prevent carpal tunnel syndrome in the workplace and decrease other costly and disabling occupational illnesses.
How do I know if I have risk factors for heart disease?
Talk to your doctor or nurse about your risk factors for heart disease.

What is Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease?
Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease PMD is a rare, progressive, degenerative central nervous system disorder in which coordination, motor abilities, and intellectual function deteriorate.
The disease is one of a group of gene-linked disorders known as the leukodystrophies, which affect growth of the myelin sheath -- the fatty covering that wraps around and protects nerve fibers in the brain.
The disease is caused by a mutation in the gene that controls the production of a myelin protein called proteolipid protein-1 PLP1.
PMD is inherited as an X-linked recessive trait; the affected individuals are male and the mothers are carriers of the PLP1 mutation.
Severity and onset of the disease ranges widely, depending on the type of PLP1 mutation.
PMD is one of a spectrum of diseases associated with PLP1, which also includes Spastic Paraplegia Type 2 SPG2.
The PLP1-related disorders span a continuum of neurologic symptoms that range from severe central nervous system involvement PMD to progressive weakness and stiffness of the legs SPG2.

Who is at risk for getting head lice?
Head lice are found worldwide.
In the United States, infestation with head lice is most common among pre-school children attending child care, elementary schoolchildren, and the household members of infested children.
Although reliable data on how many people in the United States get head lice each year are not available, an estimated 6 million to 12 million infestations occur each year in the United States among children 3 to 11 years of age.
In the United States, infestation with head lice is much less common among African-Americans than among persons of other races, possibly because the claws of the of the head louse found most frequently in the United States are better adapted for grasping the shape and width of the hair shaft of other races.
What is a spinal cord injury?
Penetrating injuries, such as gunshot or knife wounds, damage the spinal cord; however, most traumatic injuries do not completely sever the spinal cord.
Instead, an injury is more likely to cause fractures and compression of the vertebrae, which then crush and destroy the axons that carry signals up and down the spinal cord.
A spinal cord injury can damage a few, many, or almost all of the axons that cross the site of injury.
A variety of cells located in and around the injury site may also die.
Some injuries in which there is little or no nerve cell death but only pressure-induced blockage of nerve signaling or only demyelination without axonal damage will allow almost complete recovery.
Others in which there is complete cell death across even a thin horizontal level of the spinal cord will result in complete paralysis.
How Can Kawasaki Disease Be Prevented?
Kawasaki disease can't be prevented.
However, most children who have the disease recover - usually within weeks of getting signs and symptoms.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome POTS is one of a group of disorders that have orthostatic intolerance OI as their primary symptom.
OI describes a condition in which an excessively reduced volume of blood returns to the heart after an individual stands up from a lying down position.
The primary symptom of OI is lightheadedness or fainting.
In POTS, the lightheadedness or fainting is also accompanied by a rapid increase in heartbeat of more than 30 beats per minute, or a heart rate that exceeds 120 beats per minute, within 10 minutes of rising.
The faintness or lightheadedness of POTS are relieved by lying down again.
Anyone at any age can develop POTS, but the majority of individuals affected between 75 and 80 percent are women between the ages of 15 to 50 years of age.
Some women report an increase in episodes of POTS right before their menstrual periods.
POTS often begins after a pregnancy, major surgery, trauma, or a viral illness.
It may make individuals unable to exercise because the activity brings on fainting spells or dizziness.

What is the large intestine?
The large intestine is part of the GI tract, a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus - a 1-inch-long opening through which stool leaves the body.
The body digests food using the movement of muscles in the GI tract, along with the release of hormones and enzymes.
Organs that make up the GI tract are the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine - which includes the appendix, cecum, colon, and rectum - and anus.
The intestines are sometimes called the bowel.
The last part of the GI tract - called the lower GI tract - consists of the large intestine and anus.

Lead-based paint and lead contaminated dust are the most hazardous sources of lead for U.S.
children.
Lead-based paints were banned for use in housing in 1978.
All houses built before 1978 are likely to contain some lead-based paint.
However, it is the deterioration of this paint that causes a problem.
Approximately 24 million housing units have deteriorated leaded paint and elevated levels of lead-contaminated house dust.
More than 4 million of these dwellings are homes to one or more young children.

What is the prognosis for Transverse Myelitis?
Most individuals will have only one episode of transverse myelitis.
Recovery usually begins within 2 to 12 weeks of the onset of symptoms and may continue for up to 2 years and in some cases longer--requiring aggressive physical therapy and rehabilitation.
However, if there is no improvement within the first 3 to 6 months, complete recovery is unlikely although some recovery can occur.
Historic data, shows that about one-third of people affected with transverse myelitis experience good or full recovery from their symptoms.
Another one-third show only fair recovery and are left with significant deficits.
The remaining one-third show no recovery at all, with marked dependence on others for basic functions of daily living.
New, more aggressive treatment protocols may result in greater recovery statistics.

If diarrhea is caused by bacteria or parasites, over-the-counter medicines may prolong the problem, so doctors usually prescribe antibiotics instead.
How is Laser surgery mostly used?
Laser surgery mostly is used to treat smaller varicose veins.
What is Pompe Disease?
Pompe disease is a rare estimated at 1 in every 40,000 births, inherited and often fatal disorder that disables the heart and skeletal muscles.
It is caused by mutations in a gene that makes an enzyme called acid alpha-glucosidase GAA.
Normally, the body uses GAA to break down glycogen, a stored form of sugar used for energy.
The enzyme performs its function in intracellular compartments called lysosomes.
Lysosomes are known to function as cellular clearinghouses; they ingest multiple substances including glycogen, which is converted by the GAA into glucose, a sugar that fuels muscles.
In Pompe disease, mutations in the GAA gene reduce or completely eliminate this essential enzyme.
Excessive amounts of lysosomal glycogen accumulate everywhere in the body, but the cells of the heart and skeletal muscles are the most seriously affected.
Researchers have identified up to 300 different mutations in the GAA gene that cause the symptoms of Pompe disease, which can vary widely in terms of age of onset and severity.
The severity of the disease and the age of onset are related to the degree of enzyme deficiency.
What Are the Different Types of TBI?
Skull fractures can cause bruising of brain tissue called a contusion.
A contusion is a distinct area of swollen brain tissue mixed with blood released from broken blood vessels.
A contusion can also occur in response to shaking of the brain back and forth within the confines of the skull, an injury called .
contrecoup .
This injury often occurs in car accidents after high-speed stops and in shaken baby syndrome, a severe form of head injury that occurs when a baby is shaken forcibly enough to cause the brain to bounce against the skull.
In addition, contrecoup can cause diffuse axonal injury , also called shearing , which involves damage to individual nerve cells  neurons  and loss of connections among neurons.
This can lead to a breakdown of overall communication among neurons in the brain.
Want to Know More About Shingles?

What are the different types of Machado-Joseph Disease?
All persons with MJD have the same disease gene mutation: a DNA repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene.
The wide range in symptoms among affected individuals led researchers to separate the disease into distinct types that are broadly distinguished by age of onset and range of symptoms.
Type I MJD is characterized by onset between about 10 and 30 years of age, with faster progression and more dystonia and rigidity than ataxia.
Type II, the most common type of MJD, generally begins between the ages of about 20 and 50 years, has an intermediate rate of progression, and causes various symptoms, including prominent ataxia, spastic gait, and enhanced reflex responses.
Individuals affected by type III MJD have the latest onset of disease beginning between approximately 40 and 70 years of age which progresses relatively slowly and is characterized as much by peripheral neuromuscular involvement muscle twitching, weakness, atrophy, and abnormal sensations such as numbness, tingling, cramps, and pain in the hands and feet as by ataxia.
Most individuals with MJD, but especially those with types I and II, experience one or more problems with vision, including double vision or blurred vision, loss of ability to distinguish color and/or contrast, and inability to control eye movements.
Some individuals also experience prominent Parkinson's disease-like symptoms, such as slowness of movement, rigidity or stiffness of the limbs and trunk, and tremor or trembling in the hands.

Where is West Nile virus a problem?
Almost all of the continental US has had human West Nile virus cases.
Some states, such as those with the darkest shades of blue on the map to the right, had greater concentrations of cases of severe disease than others represented in lighter colors in 2010.
This can change each year.
Some areas of the US are affected by other viruses such as eastern equine encephalitis virus, LaCrosse encephalitis virus and dengue.
Are you getting enough sleep?
Insufficient sleep is associated with a number of chronic diseases and conditions - such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and depression - which threaten our nation's health.
Not getting enough sleep is associated with the onset of these diseases and also may complicate their management and outcome.
What Are the Symptoms of Osteogenesis Imperfecta?
All people with osteogenesis imperfecta have brittle bones.
OI can range from mild to severe and symptoms vary from person to person.
Some of the symptoms that people with OI may have are:
How Is Osteoporosis Treated?
A balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D.
What is Sleep Apnea?
Sleep apnea is a common sleep disorder characterized by brief interruptions of breathing during sleep.
These episodes usually last 10 seconds or more and occur repeatedly throughout the night.
People with sleep apnea will partially awaken as they struggle to breathe, but in the morning they will not be aware of the disturbances in their sleep.
The most common type of sleep apnea is obstructive sleep apnea OSA, caused by relaxation of soft tissue in the back of the throat that blocks the passage of air.
Central sleep apnea CSA is caused by irregularities in the brain's normal signals to breathe.
Most people with sleep apnea will have a combination of both types.
The hallmark symptom of the disorder is excessive daytime sleepiness.
Additional symptoms of sleep apnea include restless sleep, loud snoring with periods of silence followed by gasps, falling asleep during the day, morning headaches, trouble concentrating, irritability, forgetfulness, mood or behavior changes, anxiety, and depression.
Not everyone who has these symptoms will have sleep apnea, but it is recommended that people who are experiencing even a few of these symptoms visit their doctor for evaluation.
Sleep apnea is more likely to occur in men than women, and in people who are overweight or obese.
What is An atrial septal defect ASD?
An atrial septal defect ASD is a hole in the part of the septum that separates the atria.
Who Needs Thoracentesis?
Other causes include lung cancer, tumors, pneumonia, tuberculosis, pulmonary embolism PULL-mun-ary EM-bo-lizm, and other lung infections.
Asbestosis as-bes-TOE-sis, sarcoidosis sar-koy-DO-sis, and reactions to some drugs also can lead to a pleural effusion.
What Causes Pulmonary Hypertension?
Some diseases and conditions also can cause group 1 PAH.
Examples include HIV infection, congenital heart disease, and sickle cell disease.
Also, the use of street drugs such as cocaine and certain diet medicines can lead to PAH.
What is the prognosis for Occipital Neuralgia?
Occipital neuralgia is not a life-threatening condition.
Many individuals will improve with therapy involving heat, rest, anti-inflammatory medications, and muscle relaxants.
Recovery is usually complete after the bout of pain has ended and the nerve damage repaired or lessened.
How is Alzheimer's disease treated?
Although there is no known cure for Alzheimer's disease, active medical management can improve the quality of life for individuals living with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers.
What is Neuroacanthocytosis?
Neuroacanthocytosis refers to a group of genetic conditions that are characterized by movement disorders and acanthocytosis abnormal, spiculated red blood cells.
Four syndromes are classified as neuroacanthocytosis: Chorea-acanthocytosis, McLeod syndrome, Huntington's disease-like 2 HDL2, and panthothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration PKAN.
Acanthocytosis may not always be observed in HDL2 and PKAN.
These disorders are caused by different genetic mutations, and the signs and symptoms vary, but usually include chorea involuntary, dance-like movements, parkinsonism slowness of movement, dystonia abnormal body postures, and problems walking.
There may also be muscle weakness, involuntary movements of the face and tongue, tongue/lip biting which is mostly characteristic of Chorea-acanthocytosis, as well as difficulty with speech and eating, cognitive impairment, psychiatric symptoms, and seizures.
Individuals with McLeod syndrome often have cardiac problems.
Many features of these disorders are due to degeneration of the basal ganglia, a part of the brain that controls movement.
Additional disorders that are also known have neurologic symptoms, acanthocytosis, and either lipoprotein disorders or systemic findings.
The diagnosis of neuroacanthocytosis is typically based on the symptoms and clinical observation, a review of family history, and the evaluation of specific laboratory and imaging studies.
Who Needs Chest MRI?
Researchers are exploring ways to use chest MRI to study blood flow in the lungs.
The test may help detect early signs of pulmonary hypertension PH.
PH is increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries.
These arteries carry blood from your heart to your lungs to pick up oxygen.
My Teenage Son Loves Milk, But It Seems to Upset His Stomach.
Could He Have Lactose Intolerance?
Most kids with lactose intolerance are able to digest milk when it is served in small amounts, and combined with other foods like cereal.
They may tolerate other dairy products such as cheese or yogurt even if milk is a problem.
Lactose-free milk products are now available in most stores, and there are pills and drops you can add to milk and dairy products that make them easier to digest.
What Is Bronchitis?
People who have bronchitis often have a cough that brings up mucus.
Mucus is a slimy substance made by the lining of the bronchial tubes.
Bronchitis also may cause wheezing a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe, chest pain or discomfort, a low fever, and shortness of breath.
What Are the Benefits of Having an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator?
An ICD works well at detecting and stopping certain life-threatening arrhythmias.
An ICD can work better than drug therapy at preventing sudden cardiac arrest, depending on the cause of the arrest.
What causes indigestion?
Sometimes a person has indigestion for which a cause cannot be found.
This type of indigestion, called functional dyspepsia, is thought to occur in the area where the stomach meets the small intestine.
The indigestion may be related to abnormal motility - the squeezing or relaxing action - of the stomach muscle as it receives, digests, and moves food into the small intestine.
How is A blood smear used?
A blood smear is used to check the appearance of your platelets under a microscope.
What research is being done for Diabetic Neuropathy?
The NINDS conducts and supports research on diabetic neuropathy to increase understanding of the disorder and find ways to prevent and cure it.
New medications are currently being examined to assess improvement or stabilization of neuropathic symptoms.
What happens during a bone density test?
A bone density test is like an x-ray or scan of your body.

It only takes about 15 minutes.
Who Is at Risk for Thrombocytopenia?
People who are at highest risk for thrombocytopenia are those affected by one of the conditions or factors discussed in What Causes Thrombocytopenia? This includes people who:
What research is being done for Alexander Disease?
Recent discoveries show that most individuals approximately 90 percent with Alexander disease have a mutation in the gene that makes glial fibrillary acidic protein GFAP.
GFAP is a normal component of the brain, but it is unclear how the mutations in this gene causes the disease.
In most cases mutations occur spontaneously are not inherited from parents.
A small number of people thought to have Alexander disease do not have identifiable mutations in GFAP, which leads researchers to believe that there may be other genetic or perhaps even non-genetic causes of Alexander disease.
Current research is aimed at understanding the mechanisms by which the mutations cause disease, developing better animal models for the disorder, and exploring potential strategies for treatment.
At present, there is no exact animal model for the disease; however, mice have been engineered to produce the same mutant forms of GFAP found in individuals with Alexander disease.
These mice form Rosenthal fibers and have a predisposition for seizures, but do not yet mimic all features of human disease such as the leukodystrophies.
One clinical study is underway to identify biomarkers of disease severity or progression in samples of blood or cerebrospinal fluid.
Such biomarkers, if found, would be a major advantage for evaluating the response to any treatments that are developed in the future.
What is Hydrocephalus?
Hydrocephalus is a condition in which the primary characteristic is excessive accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid CSF -- the clear fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord.
This excessive accumulation results in an abnormal dilation of the spaces in the brain called ventricles.
This dilation causes potentially harmful pressure on the tissues of the brain.
Hydrocephalus may be congenital or acquired.
Congenital hydrocephalus is present at birth and may be caused by genetic abnormalities or developmental disorders such as spina bifida and encephalocele.
Acquired hydrocephalus develops at the time of birth or at some point afterward and can affect individuals of all ages.
For example, hydrocephalus ex-vacuo occurs when there is damage to the brain caused by stroke or traumatic injury.
Normal pressure hydrocephalus occurs most often among the elderly.
It may result from a subarachnoid hemorrhage, head trauma, infection, tumor, or complications of surgery, although many people develop normal pressure hydrocephalus without an obvious cause.
Symptoms of hydrocephalus vary with age, disease progression, and individual differences in tolerance to CSF.
In infancy, the most obvious indication of hydrocephalus is often the rapid increase in head circumference or an unusually large head size.
In older children and adults, symptoms may include headache followed by vomiting, nausea, papilledema swelling of the optic disk, which is part of the optic nerve, downward deviation of the eyes called sunsetting, problems with balance, poor coordination, gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, slowing or loss of development in children, lethargy, drowsiness, irritability, or other changes in personality or cognition, including memory loss.
Hydrocephalus is diagnosed through clinical neurological evaluation and by using cranial imaging techniques such as ultrasonography, computer tomography CT, magnetic resonance imaging MRI, or pressure-monitoring techniques.
What if a child has fecal incontinence?
Children often develop constipation as a result of stool withholding.
They may withhold stool because they are stressed about toilet training, embarrassed to use a public bathroom, do not want to interrupt playtime, or are fearful of having a painful or unpleasant bowel movement.
Why is testing for Hepatitis B important?
Hepatitis B testing identifies people living with chronic Hepatitis B so they can get medical care, which can help prevent serious liver damage.
Testing also helps find other people who may not have Hepatitis B, but are at risk for getting infected.
This can include people living with someone with Hepatitis B.
These people can get the vaccine to prevent getting Hepatitis B.
What causes meningitis and encephalitis?
Equine encephalitis affects horses and humans.
Eastern equine encephalitis also infects birds that live in freshwater swamps of the eastern U.S.
seaboard and along the Gulf Coast.
In humans, symptoms are seen 4-10 days following transmission and include sudden fever, general flu-like muscle pains, and headache of increasing severity, followed by coma and death in severe cases.
About half of infected patients die from the disorder.
Fewer than 10 human cases are seen annually in the United States.
Western equine encephalitis is seen in farming areas in the western and central plains states.
Symptoms begin 5-10 days following infection.
Children, particularly those under 12 months of age, are affected more severely than adults and may have permanent neurologic damage.
Death occurs in about 3 percent of cases.
Venezuelan equine encephalitis is very rare in this country.
Children are at greatest risk of developing severe complications, while adults generally develop flu-like symptoms.
Epidemics in South and Central America have killed thousands of persons and left others with permanent, severe neurologic damage.
Q: How long will the HPV vaccine last?
A: Protection provided by HPV vaccine should be long-lasting.
Data from clinical trials and ongoing research show that HPV vaccine lasts in the body for at least 10 years without becoming less effective.
There is no evidence to suggest that HPV vaccine loses the ability to provide protection over time.
When Should I Call a Health Care Provider?
Most cases of pink eye are mild and get better without treatment.
However, some forms are more severe.
Severe cases need to be looked at by a health care provider and may require specific treatment and close follow-up.
If you have pink eye, you should see your health care provider if you have -
3.
Why can't I make my own weights for working out?
Many suggestions exist for home-made weights, ranging from lifting one-pound soup cans harmless for you and the soup, but it won't build muscle, to lifting buckets or gallon jugs filled with sand.
Please do not improvise! Plastic jugs and buckets are not made for strength training: they're not designed to hold that much weight and the handles are designed for carrying, not lifting.
They could easily break and injure you, not to mention impede your ability to perform an exercise with proper form and through the full range of motion.
What Kind of Doctor Treats Growth Plate Injuries?
For all but the simplest injuries, your child's doctor will probably refer him or her to an orthopaedic surgeon a doctor who specializes in bone and joint problems in children and adults for treatment.
Some problems may require the services of a pediatric orthopaedic surgeon, who specializes in injuries and musculoskeletal disorders in children.
What are the other forms of NCL?
Infantile NCL INCL or Santavuori-Haltia disease begins between about ages 6 months and 2 years and progresses rapidly.
Affected children fail to thrive and have microcephaly.
Also typical are short, sharp muscle contractions called myoclonic jerks.
These children usually die before age 5, although some have survived in a vegetative state a few years longer.
What is the prognosis for Tuberous?
The prognosis for individuals with TSC is highly variable and depends on the severity of symptoms.
Tthose individuals with mild symptoms usually do well and have a normal life expectancy, while paying attention to TSC-specific issues.
Individuals who are severely affected can suffer from severe mental retardation and persistent epilepsy.
What are the symptoms of the flu versus the symptoms of a cold?
In general, the flu is worse than the common cold, and symptoms such as fever, body aches, extreme tiredness, and dry cough are more common and intense.
Colds are usually milder than the flu.
People with colds are more likely to have a runny or stuffy nose.
Colds generally do not result in serious health problems, such as pneumonia, bacterial infections, or hospitalizations.
What is viral hepatitis?
Researchers are looking for other viruses that may cause hepatitis, but none have been identified with certainty.
Other viruses that less often affect the liver include cytomegalovirus; Epstein-Barr virus, also called infectious mononucleosis; herpesvirus; parvovirus; and adenovirus.
What is Cardioversion usually?
Cardioversion usually is a scheduled procedure.
What is Hepatitis B?
Hepatitis B is a liver disease spread through contact with blood, semen, or other body fluids from a person infected with the hepatitis B virus.
What Are the Signs and Symptoms of COPD?
Not everyone who has the symptoms above has COPD.
Likewise, not everyone who has COPD has these symptoms.
Some of the symptoms of COPD are similar to the symptoms of other diseases and conditions.
Your doctor can find out whether you have COPD.
Who Gets Heritable Disorders of Connective Tissue?
Heritable disorders of connective tissue can affect people of all ethnic groups.
All ages, and both sexes are affected.
Many of these disorders are rare.
Some may not be evident at birth, but only appear after a certain age or after exposure to a particular environmental stress.
Is there any treatment for Shingles?
In 2006, the Food and Drug Administration approved a VZV vaccine Zostavax for use in people 60 and older who have had chickenpox.
In March 2011, the FDA extended the approval to inlcude adults 50 to 59 as well.
Researchers found that giving older adults the vaccine reduced the expected number of later cases of shingles by half.
And in people who still got the disease despite immunization, the severity and complications of shingles were dramatically reduced.
The shingles vaccine is a preventive therapy and not a treatment for those who already have shingles or postherpetic neuralgia.
What is A liver biopsy?
A liver biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a small piece of liver tissue for examination with a microscope for signs of damage or disease.
The overall risk of developing an MRSA infection after influenza appears to be very low.
However, CDC continues to work with state and local public health authorities to better understand this association.
Following a healthy diet is an important part of a heart healthy lifestyle.
Guillain-Barre syndrome GBS is a rare disorder in which a person's own immune system damages their nerve cells, causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis.
GBS can cause symptoms that last for a few weeks.
Most people recover fully from GBS, but some people have permanent nerve damage.
In very rare cases, people have died of GBS, usually from difficulty breathing.
In the United States, for example, an estimated 3,000 to 6,000 people develop GBS each year on average, whether or not they received a vaccination.
Adult Refsum disease ARD is a rare genetic disease that causes weakness or numbness of the hands and feet peripheral neuropathy.
Due to a genetic abnormality, people with ARD disease lack the enzyme in peroxisomes that break down phytanic acid, a type of fat found in certain foods.
As a result, toxic levels of phytanic acid build up in the brain, blood, and other tissues.
The disease usually begins in late childhood or early adulthood with increasing night blindness due to degeneration of the retina retinitis pigmentosa.
If the disease progresses, other symptoms may include deafness, loss of the sense of smell anosmia, problems with balance and coordination ataxia, dry and scaly skin ichthyosis, and heartbeat abnormalities cardiac arrhythmias.
Some individuals will have shortened bones in their fingers or toes, or a visibly shortened fourth toe.
Although the disease usually appears in early childhood, some people will not develop symptoms until their 40s or 50s.
The cause of ASD, including Asperger syndrome, is not known.
Current research points to brain abnormalities in Asperger syndrome.
Using advanced brain imaging techniques, scientists have revealed structural and functional differences in specific regions of the brains of children who have Asperger syndrome versus those who do not have the disorder.
These differences may be caused by the abnormal migration of embryonic cells during fetal development that affects brain structure and 'wiring' in early childhood and then goes on to affect the neural circuits that control thought and behavior.
Hydrocephalus is diagnosed through clinical neurological evaluation and by using cranial imaging techniques such as ultrasonography, CT, MRI, or pressure-monitoring techniques.
A physician selects the appropriate diagnostic tool based on an individual's age, clinical presentation, and the presence of known or suspected abnormalities of the brain or spinal cord.
The National Institutes of Health NIH, through the collaborative efforts of its National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS, National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases NIAMS, and National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences NIEHS, conducts and supports a wide range of research on neuromuscular disorders, including the inflammatory myopathies.
The NINDS and NIAMS are funding DNA analyses using microarrays to characterize patterns of muscle gene expression among adult and juvenile individuals with distinct subtypes of inflammatory myopathies.
Findings will be used to refine disease classification and provide clues to the pathology of these disorders.
Other NIH-funded research is studying prior viral infection as a precursor to inflammatory myopathy.
Other research hopes to determine whether the drug infliximab, which blocks a protein that is associated with harmful inflammation, is safe and effective in treating dermatomyositis and polymyositis.
In general, adopting healthy habits-such as maintaining optimal weight, avoiding exposure to toxins, following a physician-supervised exercise program, eating a balanced diet, correcting vitamin deficiencies, and limiting or avoiding alcohol consumption-can reduce the physical and emotional effects of peripheral neuropathy.
Active and passive forms of exercise can reduce cramps, improve muscle strength, and prevent muscle wasting in paralyzed limbs.
Various dietary strategies can improve gastrointestinal symptoms.
Timely treatment of injury can help prevent permanent damage.
Quitting smoking is particularly important because smoking constricts the blood vessels that supply nutrients to the peripheral nerves and can worsen neuropathic symptoms.
Self-care skills such as meticulous foot care and careful wound treatment in people with diabetes and others who have an impaired ability to feel pain can alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life.
Such changes often create conditions that encourage nerve regeneration.
Blacks who are aware that they have HIV are not getting the medical care they need.
Data from 19 U.S.
areas show that only 1 in 3 blacks with a diagnosis of HIV are getting medical care and have viral suppression.
Viral suppression means the level of virus in your blood is low enough to help you stay healthy and greatly decrease the chance of spreading the virus to others.
Researchers are studying the reasons celiac disease affects people differently.
The length of time a person was breastfed, the age a person started eating gluten-containing foods, and the amount of gluten-containing foods one eats are three factors thought to play a role in when and how celiac disease appears.
Some studies have shown, for example, that the longer a person was breastfed, the later the symptoms of celiac disease appear.
Inherited LQTS usually is first detected during childhood or young adulthood.
Half of all people who have LQTS have their first abnormal heart rhythm by the time they're 12 years old, and 90 percent by the time they're 40 years old.
The condition rarely is diagnosed after age 40.
Without enough surfactant, the lungs collapse and the infant has to work hard to breathe.
He or she might not be able to breathe in enough oxygen to support the body's organs.
The lack of oxygen can damage the baby's brain and other organs if proper treatment isn't given.
For several decades the term 'tropical spastic paraparesis' TSP has been used to describe a chronic and progressive disease of the nervous system that affects adults living in equatorial areas of the world and causes progressive weakness, stiff muscles, muscle spasms, sensory disturbance, and sphincter dysfunction.
The cause of TSP was obscure until the mid-1980s, when an important association was established between the human retrovirus - human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type 1 also known as HTLV-1 - and TSP.
TSP is now called HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/ tropical spastic paraparesis or HAM/TSP.
The HTLV-1 retrovirus is thought to cause at least 80 percent of the cases of HAM/TSP by impairing the immune system.
In addition to neurological symptoms of weakness and muscle stiffness or spasms, in rare cases individuals with HAM/TSP also exhibit uveitis inflammation of the uveal tract of the eye, arthritis inflammation of one or more joints, pulmonary lymphocytic alveolitis inflammation of the lung, polymyositis an inflammatory muscle disease, keratoconjunctivitis sicca persistent dryness of the cornea and conjunctiva, and infectious dermatitis inflammation of the skin.
The other serious complication of HTLV-1 infection is the development of adult T-cell leukemia or lymphoma.
Nervous system and blood-related complications occur only in a very small proportion of infected individuals, while most remain largely without symptoms throughout their lives.
The disorder is characterized by recurrences and remissions, and successive recurrences may incapacitate the patient.
Due to the intensity of the pain, even the fear of an impending attack may prevent activity.
Trigeminal neuralgia is not fatal.
Metabolic syndrome.
Metabolic syndrome is the name for a group of risk factors that raise your risk for stroke and other health problems, such as diabetes and heart disease.
The five metabolic risk factors are a large waistline abdominal obesity, a high triglyceride tri-GLIS-er-ide level a type of fat found in the blood, a low HDL cholesterol level, high blood pressure, and high blood sugar.
Metabolic syndrome is diagnosed if you have at least three of these metabolic risk factors.
Osteoporosis is a real risk for older Hispanics and Latinos.
There are many good sources of information about Paget's disease.
These include:
There is no known cure for Sjoegren's syndrome nor is there a specific treatment to restore gland secretion.
Treatment is generally symptomatic and supportive.
Moisture replacement therapies may ease the symptoms of dryness.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be used to treat musculoskeletal symptoms.
For individuals with severe complications, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs may be prescribed.
Cockroaches roaches and their droppings may cause asthma.
The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS, a part of the National Institutes of Health, supports research about MSA through grants to major medical institutions across the country.
In 2007, the NINDS sponsored a consensus conference that brought together experts from around the world to review and update the diagnostic criteria for MSA.
These new diagnostic guidelines are helping doctors make quicker and more accurate diagnoses of MSA.
A great deal of research is ongoing to learn why synuclein buildup occurs in MSA and Parkinson's disease, and how to prevent it.
Benign essential blepharospasm BEB is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions and spasms of the eyelid muscles.
It is a form of dystonia, a movement disorder in which muscle contractions cause sustained eyelid closure, twitching or repetitive movements.
BEB begins gradually with increased frequency of eye blinking often associated with eye irritation.
Other symptoms may include increasing difficulty in keeping the eyes open, and light sensitivity.
Generally, the spasms occur during the day, disappear in sleep, and reappear after waking.
As the condition progresses, the spasms may intensify, forcing the eyelids to remain closed for long periods of time, and thereby causing substantial visual disturbance or functional blindness.
It is important to note that the blindness is caused solely by the uncontrollable closing of the eyelids and not by a dysfunction of the eyes.
BEB occurs in both men and women, although it is especially common in middle-aged and elderly women.
The prognosis depends on the specific subtype of congenital myasthenia, the muscles involved, and the age at onset of symptoms.
If a child has difficulty breathing, feeding, or swallowing, they may be vulnerable to pneumonia or respiratory failure.
In other cases, weakness is stable and does not worsen over time.
In one subtype, weakness improves with time.
Life-span is normal in most cases in which respiratory function is not compromised.
Always read the Nutrition Facts food label to find out the calorie content.
Remember, this is the calorie content for one serving of the food item, so be sure and check the serving size.
If you eat more than one serving, you'll be eating more calories than is listed on the food label.

Rheumatoid arthritis is primarily a disease of the joints.
A joint is the point where two or more bones come together.
With a few exceptions in the skull and pelvis, for example, joints are designed to allow movement between the bones and to absorb shock from movements like walking or repetitive motions.
The ends of the bones are covered by a tough, elastic tissue called cartilage.
The joint is surrounded by a capsule that protects and supports it see illustration.
The joint capsule is lined with a type of tissue called synovium, which produces synovial fluid, a clear substance that lubricates and nourishes the cartilage and bones inside the joint capsule.
Ehrlichiosis is the general name used to describe several bacterial diseases that affect animals and humans.
Carbon monoxide, or CO, is an odorless, colorless gas that can cause sudden illness and death.

A liver transplant is an operation to remove a diseased or an injured liver and replace it with a healthy one from another person, called a donor.
Bronchoscopy is a safe procedure.
Hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing.
For example, your doctor may put a special type of dye in the catheter.
The dye will flow through your bloodstream to your heart.
Then, your doctor will take x-ray pictures of your heart.
The dye will make your coronary heart arteries visible on the pictures.
This test is called coronary angiography an-jee-OG-rah-fee.
Help your child stay at a healthy weight by balancing what your child eats with physical activity.
Two of the best ways to prevent overweight and obesity in your child are to:
Anyone can get a foodborne illness.
However, some people are more likely to develop foodborne illnesses than others, including.
Carotid ka-ROT-id ultrasound is a painless and harmless test that uses high-frequency sound waves to create pictures of the insides of your carotid arteries.
If lifestyle changes aren't enough, your doctor may prescribe medicines.
Medicines are used to treat and control risk factors such as high blood pressure, high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, and high blood sugar.
The NINDS supports research on neuromuscular disorders such as KSS.
The goals of this research are to increase understanding of these disorders, and to find ways to prevent, treat, and, ultimately, cure them.
The most promising approach for treatment in the future will be to alter replication or destroy abnormal mitochondria.
We know that many more women than men have lupus.
Lupus is two to three times more common in African American women than in Caucasian women and is also more common in women of Hispanic, Asian, and Native American descent.
African American and Hispanic women are also more likely to have active disease and serious organ system involvement.
In addition, lupus can run in families, but the risk that a child or a brother or sister of a patient will also have lupus is still quite low.
It is difficult to estimate how many people in the United States have the disease, because its symptoms vary widely and its onset is often hard to pinpoint.
Unfortunately, there is no cure for the disease.
There is no cure for Parkinson's disease.
Many patients are only mildly affected and need no treatment for several years after the initial diagnosis.
When symptoms grow severe, doctors usually prescribe levodopa L-dopa, which helps replace the brain's dopamine.
Sometimes doctors prescribe other drugs that affect dopamine levels in the brain.
In patients who are very severely affected, a kind of brain surgery known as pallidotomy has reportedly been effective in reducing symptoms.
Another kind of brain surgery, in which healthy dopamine-producing tissue is transplanted into the brain, is also being tested.
Finally, researchers are trying to identify substances that will prevent dopamine-producing brain cells from dying.
There are different ways to test for colorectal cancer.
Some tests are done every 1 to 2 years.
Other tests are done every 5 to 10 years.
Your doctor can help you decide which test is right for you and how often to get screened.
Fruits and vegetables are part of a well-balanced and healthy eating plan.
There are many different ways to lose or maintain a healthy weight.
Using more fruits and vegetables along with whole grains and lean meats, nuts, and beans is a safe and healthy one.
Helping control your weight is not the only benefit of eating more fruits and vegetables.
Diets rich in fruits and vegetables may reduce the risk of some types of cancer and other chronic diseases.
Fruits and vegetables also provide essential vitamins and minerals, fiber, and other substances that are important for good health.
Fibrous dysplasia is caused by a defective gene in the cells that form bone and other affected tissues.
The defect occurs at some point after conception, most likely early in fetal development.
This means that the disorder is not inherited from an affected person's parents, nor can an affected person with the condition pass it on to his or her children.
Smoking increases the risk of developing pancreatitis.
Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas, which is located behind the stomach and close to the duodenum.
The pancreas secretes digestive enzymes that usually do not become active until they reach the small intestine.
When the pancreas is inflamed, the digestive enzymes attack the tissues of the pancreas.
Because the facial nerve has so many functions and is so complex, damage to the nerve or a disruption in its function can lead to many problems.
Symptoms of Bell's palsy can vary from person to person and range in severity from mild weakness to total paralysis.
These symptoms may include twitching, weakness, or paralysis on one or rarely both sides of the face.
Other symptoms may include drooping of the eyelid and corner of the mouth, drooling, dryness of the eye or mouth, impairment of taste, and excessive tearing in one eye.
Most often these symptoms, which usually begin suddenly and reach their peak within 48 hours, lead to significant facial distortion.
Autosomalrecessive inheritance occurs when both parents carry and pass on a copy of the faulty gene, but neither parent is affected by the disorder.
Each child born to these parents has a 25 percent chance of inheriting both copies of the defective gene, a 50 percent chance of being a carrier like the prents, and a 25 percent chance of not inheriting either copy of the defective gene.
Children of either gender can be affected by an autosomal recessive this pattern of inheritance.
Neuro-myelitis optica is a disorder associated with transverse myelitis as well as optic nerve inflammation.
Adults tend to have the chronic long-lasting type of ITP.
Women are two to three times more likely than men to develop chronic ITP.
Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in the United States, yet most cases are preventable.
If your doctor suspects you have iron overload associated with hemochromatosis, there are two blood tests - serum transferrin saturation and ferritin levels - which may be used to help make the diagnosis.
The tests measure how much iron is in the body.
You can have these tests done in your doctor's office.
Angioplasty is a nonsurgical procedure that opens blocked or narrow coronary arteries.
Fibrous dysplasia is an uncommon disorder.

Physicians now use an array of traditional and new imaging technologies to uncover the presence of AVMs.
Angiography provides the most accurate pictures of blood vessel structure in AVMs.
The technique requires injecting a special water-soluble dye, called a contrast agent, into an artery.
The dye highlights the structure of blood vessels so that it can be recorded on conventional X-rays.
Although angiography can record fine details of vascular lesions, the procedure is somewhat invasive and carries a slight risk of causing a stroke.
Its safety, however, has recently been improved through the development of more precise techniques for delivering dye to the site of an AVM.
Superselective angiography involves inserting a thin, flexible tube called a catheter into an artery; a physician guides the tip of the catheter to the site of the lesion and then releases a small amount of contrast agent directly into the lesion.
The H5N1 Inventory should be used by those conducting surveillance in humans and animals as well as research on influenza H5N1 viruses as a reference for the identification of specific mutations in naturally occurring H5N1 viruses that may signal adaptation to mammalian species or alter susceptibility to existing antivirals.
Surveillance and research teams that identify viruses with mutations of concern should alert a relevant WHO Collaborating Center or an H5N1 reference laboratory and submit the virus for further characterization and risk assessment.
Contact information for these laboratories can be found on the World Health Organization WHO website and the OIE website.
Please ensure that your national veterinary services are informed when influenza viruses are detected in animals.
All H5N1 avian influenza viruses in poultry and all HPAI viruses in birds are notifiable to OIE; please consult http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.10.4.htm for further information about the definition of notifiable avian influenza.
Testing your home is the only way to know if your home has a radon problem.
Sleep apnea is a common disorder that causes pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep.
The possibilities for treatment depend on the specific subtype of congenital myasthenia.
Most treatments attempt to improve the signaling between nerve cell and muscle.
These drugs include pyridostigmine, fluoxetine, ephedrine, and 3,4-diaminopyridine.
Treatments to alter the immune system are not used for this form of myasthenia.
There are no treatments to cure the underlying genetic abnormality.
Trigeminal neuralgia is a sharp, stabbing, facial pain caused by MS affecting the trigeminal nerve as it exits the brainstem on its way to the jaw and cheek.
To check how blood is flowing to the heart muscle.
If part of the heart muscle isn't getting blood, it may be a sign of coronary heart disease CHD.
CHD can lead to chest pain called angina an-JI-nuh or AN-juh-nuh, a heart attack, and other heart problems.
When a nuclear heart scan is done for this purpose, it's called myocardial perfusion scanning.
Medicines are used to stop your heart.
This allows the surgeons to operate on your heart while it's still.
A heart-lung bypass machine keeps oxygen-rich blood moving through your body during surgery.
Chiari malformations CMs are structural defects in the cerebellum, the part of the brain that controls balance.
When the indented bony space at the lower rear of the skull is smaller than normal, the cerebellum and brain stem can be pushed downward.
The resulting pressure on the cerebellum can block the flow of cerebrospinal fluid the liquid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord and can cause a range of symptoms including dizziness, muscle weakness, numbness, vision problems, headache, and problems with balance and coordination.
Symptoms may change for some individuals depending on buildup of CNS and any resulting pressure on tissue and nerves.
CMs are classified by the severity of the disorder and the parts of the brain that protrude into the spinal canal.
The most common is Type I, which may not cause symptoms and is often found by accident during an examination for another condition.
Type II also called Arnold-Chiari malformation is usually accompanied by a myelomeningocele-a form of spina bifida that occurs when the spinal canal and backbone do not close before birth, causing the spinal cord to protrude through an opening in the back.
This can cause partial or complete paralysis below the spinal opening.
Type III is the most serious form of CM, and causes severe neurological defects.
Other conditions sometimes associated with CM include hydrocephalus, syringomyelia a fluid-filled cyst in the spinal cord, and spinal curvature.
Share your concerns with your child's doctor.
If you or your doctor think there could be a problem, ask for a referral to see a developmental pediatrician or other specialist, and contact your local early intervention agency for children under 3 or public school for children 3 and older to find out if your child qualifies for intervention services.
To find out who to speak to in your area, you can contact the National Dissemination Center for Children with Disabilities by logging on to www.nichcy.org/ or calling 1-800-695-0285.
For more information about what to do if you are concerned about your child's development visit If you're concerned at www.cdc.gov/concerned.
If there is a problem, it is very important to get your child help as soon as possible.
Improved emergency care for people with spinal cord injuries and aggressive treatment and rehabilitation can minimize damage to the nervous system and even restore limited abilities.
Respiratory complications are often an indication of the severity of spinal cord injury About one-third of those with injury to the neck area will need help with breathing and require respiratory support.
The steroid drug methylprednisolone appears to reduce the damage to nerve cells if it is given within the first 8 hours after injury.
Rehabilitation programs combine physical therapies with skill-building activities and counseling to provide social and emotional support.
Electrical simulation of nerves by neural prosthetic devices may restore specific functions, including bladder, breathing, cough, and arm or leg movements, though eligibility for use fo these devices depends on the level and type of the spinal cord injury.
Combination chemotherapy is the use of more than one anticancer drug.
Medicines, including those you can buy over the counter such as vitamins and herbal supplements, may have a stronger effect on you.
Your liver does not break medicines down as quickly as a healthy liver would.
Although stroke is a disease of the brain, it can affect the entire body.
Some of the disabilities that can result from a stroke include paralysis, cognitive deficits, speech problems, emotional difficulties, daily living problems, and pain.
The cause of UC is unknown though theories exist.
People with UC have abnormalities of the immune system, but whether these problems are a cause or a result of the disease is still unclear.
The immune system protects people from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances.
With UC, the body's immune system is believed to react abnormally to bacteria in the digestive tract.
UC sometimes runs in families and research studies have shown that certain gene abnormalities are found more often in people with UC.
You can prevent asbestos-related lung diseases by limiting your exposure to asbestos fibers.
If your job requires you to work around asbestos, make sure to follow workplace rules for handling it.
For example, make sure that air levels are measured, and wear a proper respirator to avoid breathing in asbestos fibers.
Most states require newborn screening.
But the number and types of tests are different in each state.
Depending on your family health history, you may want to ask for extra tests.
If you have narcolepsy, you may have one or more of these symptoms.
They can range from mild to severe.
Less than one-third of people who have narcolepsy have all four symptoms.
Air-conditioning is the number one protective factor against heat-related illness and death.
Many people believe that foods with no or minimal processing are better for their health.
Many people also believe that small, local farms are better sources of healthy food.
However, some types of processing are needed to protect health.
For example, consumers process raw meat, poultry, and fish for safety by cooking.
Similarly, when milk is pasteurized, it is heated just long enough to kill disease-causing germs.
Most nutrients remain after milk is pasteurized.
There are many local, small farms that offer pasteurized organic milk and cheese products.
Small changes can add up.
For example, losing just 10 pounds can lower your blood pressure.

Peripheral arterial disease P.A.D.
affects millions of people in the United States.
The disease is more common in African Americans than any other racial or ethnic group.
TN is typified by attacks that stop for a period of time and then return, but the condition can be progressive.
The attacks often worsen over time, with fewer and shorter pain-free periods before they recur.
Eventually, the pain-free intervals disappear and medication to control the pain becomes less effective.
The disorder is not fatal, but can be debilitating.
Due to the intensity of the pain, some individuals may avoid daily activities or social contacts because they fear an impending attack.
Nearly all cases of Rett syndrome are caused by a mutation in the methyl CpG binding protein 2, or MECP2 pronounced meck-pea-two gene.
Scientists identified the gene - which is believed to control the functions of many other genes - in 1999.
The MECP2 gene contains instructions for the synthesis of a protein called methyl cytosine binding protein 2 MeCP2, which is needed for brain development and acts as one of the many biochemical switches that can either increase gene expression or tell other genes when to turn off and stop producing their own unique proteins.
Because the MECP2 gene does not function properly in individuals with Rett syndrome, insufficient amounts or structurally abnormal forms of the protein are produced and can cause other genes to be abnormally expressed.
Prognosis for patients with childhood cerebral X-ALD is generally poor due to progressive neurological deterioration unless bone marrow transplantation is performed early.
Death usually occurs within 1 to 10 years after the onset of symptoms.
Adult-onset AMN will progress over decades.
For most healthy people who receive treatment soon after the outbreak of blisters, the lesions heal, the pain subsides within 3 to 5 weeks, and the blisters often leave no scars.
However, shingles is a serious threat in immunosuppressed individuals - for example, those with HIV infection or who are receiving cancer treatments that can weaken their immune systems.
People who receive organ transplants are also vulnerable to shingles because they are given drugs that suppress the immune system.
The wires in a biventricular pacemaker carry pulses from the generator to an atrium and both ventricles.
The pulses help coordinate electrical signaling between the two ventricles.
This type of pacemaker also is called a cardiac resynchronization therapy CRT device.
Hereditary pancreatitis can present in a person younger than age 30, but it might not be diagnosed for several years.
Episodes of abdominal pain and diarrhea lasting several days come and go over time and can progress to chronic pancreatitis.
A diagnosis of hereditary pancreatitis is likely if the person has two or more family members with pancreatitis in more than one generation.
Too much cholesterol in the blood, or high blood cholesterol, can be serious.
People with high blood cholesterol have a greater chance of getting heart disease.
Cholesterol can build up on the walls of your arteries blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to other parts of the body.
This buildup of cholesterol is called plaque.
Over time, plaque can cause narrowing of the arteries.
Vomiting phase.
This phase consists of intense nausea, vomiting, and retching.
Periods of vomiting and retching can last 20 to 30 minutes at a time.
The person may be subdued and responsive, immobile and unresponsive, or writhing and moaning with intense abdominal pain.
An episode can last from hours to days.
A peptic ulcer in the stomach is called a gastric ulcer.

Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
Anticonvulsants may be used to treat the seizures, but at times the seizures do not respond well to therapy, even at high doses.
Therefore, the benefit of seizure control should be weights against what could be excessive sedation from the anticonvulsant.
Valproate should not be used since it can increase the risk of liver failure.
Physical therapy may help to relieve spasticity and maintain or increase muscle tone.
Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.
Researchers found that giving older adults the vaccine reduced the expected number of cases of shingles by half.
And in people who still got the disease despite immunization, the severity and complications of shingles were dramatically reduced.
The Shingles Prevention Study - a collaboration between the Department of Veterans Affairs, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Merck & Co., Inc.
- involved more than 38,000 veterans aged 60 and older.
The purpose was to find out how safe the vaccine is, and if it can prevent shingles.
Half the study participants were vaccinated with a more potent version of the chickenpox vaccine, developed specifically for use in adults, and half received a placebo vaccine.
Neither volunteers nor researchers knew if a particular subject had gotten active or placebo vaccine until after the end of the study a double-blind study.
Your blood is thicker or more likely to clot than normal.
Some inherited conditions such as factor V Leiden increase the risk of blood clotting.
Hormone therapy or birth control pills also can increase the risk of clotting.
The other type of flu vaccine - nasal-spray flu vaccine sometimes called LAIV for 'live attenuated influenza vaccine - is not recommended for people with inflammatory arthritis.
This vaccine is made with live, weakened flu viruses that do not cause the flu.
LAIV FluMist is approved for use in healthy people 2-49 years of age.
Eating tends to trigger contractions of the large intestine that push stool toward the rectum and also cause the rectum to contract for 30 to 60 minutes.
Both these events increase the likelihood that a person will pass gas and have a bowel movement soon after eating.
This activity may increase if the person is anxious.
People with fecal incontinence may want to avoid eating in restaurants or at social gatherings, or they may want to take antidiarrheal medications before eating in these situations.
Dysautonomia refers to a disorder of autonomic nervous system ANS function.
Most physicians view dysautonomia in terms of failure of the sympathetic or parasympathetic components of the ANS, but dysautonomia involving excessive ANS activities also can occur.
Dysautonomia can be local, as in reflex sympathetic dystrophy, or generalized, as in pure autonomic failure.
It can be acute and reversible, as in Guillain-Barre syndrome, or chronic and progressive.
Several common conditions such as diabetes and alcoholism can include dysautonomia.
Dysautonomia also can occur as a primary condition or in association with degenerative neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease.
Other diseases with generalized, primary dysautonomia include multiple system atrophy and familial dysautonomia.
Hallmarks of generalized dysautonomia due to sympathetic failure are impotence in men and a fall in blood pressure during standing orthostatic hypotension.
Excessive sympathetic activity can present as hypertension or a rapid pulse rate.
Approximately 20,000 Americans - or one in every 100,000 people over the age of 60 - have PSP, making it much less common than Parkinson's disease, which affects more than 500,000 Americans.
Affected individuals are usually middle-aged or elderly, and men are affected more often than women.
PSP is often difficult to diagnose because its symptoms can be very much like those of other, more common movement disorders, and because some of the most characteristic symptoms may develop late or not at all.
Many children with NF1 have larger than normal head circumference and are shorter than average.
Hydrocephalus, the abnormal buildup of fluid in the brain, is a possible complication of the disorder.
Headache and epilepsy are also more likely in individuals with NF1 than in the healthy population.
Cardiovascular complications associated with NF1 include congenital heart defects, high blood pressure hypertension, and constricted, blocked, or damaged blood vessels vasculopathy.
Children with NF1 may have poor language and visual-spatial skills, and perform less well on academic achievement tests, including those that measure reading, spelling, and math skills.
Learning disabilities, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD, are common in children with NF1.

A carotid endarterectomy is a surgical procedure in which a doctor removes fatty deposits blocking one of the two carotid arteries, the main supply of blood for the brain.
Carotid artery problems become more common as people age.
The disease process that causes the buildup of fat and other material inside the artery walls is called atherosclerosis, popularly known as hardening of the arteries.
The fatty deposit is called plaque; the narrowing of the artery is called stenosis.
The degree of stenosis is usually expressed as a percentage of the normal diameter of the opening.
Most people with myotonia congenita don't require special treatments.
Stiff muscles usually resolve with exercise, or light movement, especially after resting.
For individuals whose symptoms are more limiting, doctors have had some success with medications such as quinine, or anticonvulsant drugs such as phenytoin.
Physical therapy and other rehabilitative therapies are also sometimes used to improve muscle function.
